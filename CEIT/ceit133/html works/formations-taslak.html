			<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the formations in crypto market?</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify" class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different ways to analyze financial markets using technical analysis (TA). Some traders use indicators and oscillators, while others base their analysis solely on price movements.<br>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candlestick charts show price movements for a specific time frame. The underlying idea is that recurring structures can emerge when the history of an asset&#8217;s price movements is examined. Candlestick patterns can provide useful information about the asset being charted, and many investors seek to capitalize on this information for the stock, forex, and cryptocurrency markets.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most common examples of these patterns are commonly referred to as classical chart patterns. These are some of the most recognizable patterns and are considered by many traders as reliable trading indicators. So what is the reason for this? Isn&#8217;t trading and investing about seizing an opportunity that others have overlooked? It is, but it&#8217;s also about community psychology. Since technical formations are not dependent on any scientific principles or laws of physics, their effectiveness largely depends on the number of market participants paying attention to them.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;"><strong>FLAGS</strong></p> 

			
				
				<p style="text-align:justify" class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flag is an area of consolidation that’s against the direction of the longer-term trend and happens after a sharp price move. It looks like a flag on a flagpole, where the pole is the impulse move, and the flag is the area of consolidation. Flags may be used to identify the potential continuation of the trend. The volume accompanying the pattern is also important. Ideally, the impulse move should happen on high volume, while the consolidation phase should have lower, decreasing volume.</p>
				<h3 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">1) Bull Flag</h3>

				<img style="width:800px;height:400px;" class="radius-border center" src="../mypage/images/bullflag.png" alt="Bull-Flag"> 
				<p style="text-align:justify" class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bull flag pattern is a chart pattern that occurs when a stock is in a strong uptrend. It is called a flag pattern because when you see it on a chart it looks like a flag on a pole and since we are in an uptrend it is considered a bullish flag. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull flag appears in an uptrend, followed by a sharp uptrend, and usually followed by an uptrend.<br></p>

				<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">2) Bear Flag</h4>
				<img style="width:800px;height:400px;" class="radius-border center" src="../mypage/images/bear-flag.png" alt="Bear-Flag">
			
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:justify" class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bear flag pattern is a formation that is usually distinguishable on the candlestick chart. It is formed from the flag pole, which is the steep downward move before the pullback, and the flag itself represents the actual retracement. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear flag appears in a downtrend, followed by a sharp downward move, and usually followed by a downward move.</p>
			
			
			
			<p style="text-align:center;" class="px k"><strong>PENNANT</strong></p>
			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/pennant.png" alt="pennant" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pennant is a type of continuation pattern formed when there is a large movement in a security, known as the flagpole, followed by a consolidation period with converging trend lines—the pennant—followed by a breakout movement in the same direction as the initial large movement, which represents the second half of the flagpole.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pennants are basically a variant of flags where the area of consolidation has converging&nbsp;<a href="../mypage/emek.html" target="_blank">trend lines</a>, more akin to a triangle. The pennant is a neutral formation; the interpretation of it highly depends on the context of the pattern.</p>
			
			
			
			<p style="text-align:center" class="px k"><strong>TRIANGLES</strong></p>
			
			
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triangle patterns are a variant of continuation patterns, indicating whether a particular trend is likely to continue. They tend to appear often in the bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets. Therefore, BTC traders can use triangle patterns as one means of timing a trade.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A triangle is a chart pattern that’s characterized by a converging price range that’s typically followed by the continuation of the trend. The triangle itself shows a pause in the underlying trend but may indicate a reversal or a continuation.Triangle chart patterns form with two trendlines that converge to a point. They come in three types: ascending triangle, descending triangle, and symmetrical triangle.</p>
				<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">1) Ascending-Triangle</h4>
				<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/Ascending-Triangle.png" alt="Ascending-Triangle" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			
			
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ascending triangle forms when there’s a horizontal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/resistance" target="_blank">resistance</a>&nbsp;area and a rising&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/trend-lines-explained" target="_blank">trend line</a>&nbsp;drawn across a series of higher lows. Essentially, each time the price bounces off the horizontal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/resistance" target="_blank">resistance</a>, the buyers step in at higher prices, creating higher lows. As tension is building at the resistance area, if the price eventually breaks through it, it tends to be followed by a quick spike up with high&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/volume" target="_blank">volume</a>. As such, the ascending triangle is a bullish pattern.</p>
			
			
			<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">2) Descending-Triangle</h4>
			<figure><img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/Descending-Triangle.png" alt="descending triangle" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></figure>
			
			
			
			<p class="px k"> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Symmetrical Triangle Chart Pattern indicates an ongoing period of price consolidation before the prices breakout.

				A bullish symmetrical triangle is a bullish continuation chart pattern, the movement preceding the triangle’s formation must be bullish.
				
				On the other hand, A bearish symmetrical triangle is a bearish continuation chart pattern, the movement preceding the triangle’s formation must be bearish.
				
				The symmetrical triangle pattern is different from a descending or ascending triangle pattern as both triangles’ lower and upper trend lines slope towards the center point.
				
				A horizontal upper trendline is formed in ascending triangles that predict a higher breakout.
				
				With a descending triangle, a horizontal lower trendline is formed that predicts a lower breakout.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The descending triangle is the inverse of the ascending triangle. It forms when there’s a horizontal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/support" target="_blank">support</a>&nbsp;area and a falling&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/trend-lines-explained" target="_blank">trend line</a>&nbsp;drawn across a series of lower highs. In the same way as the ascending triangle, each time price bounces off the horizontal&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/support" target="_blank">support</a>, sellers step in at lower prices, creating lower highs. Typically, if the price breaks through the horizontal support area, it’s followed by a quick spike down with high&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/volume" target="_blank">volume</a>. This makes it a bearish pattern.&nbsp;</p>
			
			
			<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">2) Symetrical Triangle</h4>
			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/symetrical-triangle-4.png" alt="symetrical-triangle" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			

			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symmetrical triangle is drawn by a falling upper&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/trend-lines-explained" target="_blank">trend line</a>&nbsp;and a rising lower trend line, both happening at roughly an equal slope. The symmetrical triangle is neither a bullish nor a bearish pattern, as its interpretation heavily depends on the context (namely, the underlying trend). On its own, it’s considered to be a neutral pattern, simply representing a period of consolidation.</p>
			
			
			
			<p style="text-align:center" class="px k"><strong>WEDGES</strong></p>
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wedge is drawn by converging&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/trend-lines-explained" target="_blank">trend lines</a>, indicating tightening price action. The trend lines, in this case, show that the highs and lows are either rising or falling at a different rate. It might mean that a reversal is impending, as the underlying trend is getting weaker. A wedge pattern may be accompanied by decreasing volume, also indicating that the trend might be losing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/market-momentum" target="_blank">momentum</a></p>

			<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">1) Rising Wedge</h4>
			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/rising-wedge.png" alt="rising-wedge" style="width:800px;height:400px;">

	
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is found in a downtrend, it is considered a bearish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the downtrend is in the making.

				In a rising wedge, both boundary lines slant up from left to right. Although both lines point in the same direction, the lower line rises at a steeper angle than the upper one. Prices usually decline after breaking through the lower boundary line. As far as volumes are concerned, they keep on declining with each new price advance or wave up, indicating that the demand is weakening at the higher price level. A rising wedge is more reliable when found in a bearish market. In a bullish trend what seems to be a Rising Wedge may actually be a Flag or a Pennant (stepbrother of a wedge) requiring about 4 weeks to complete.</a>.&nbsp;</p>
			
			
			<h4 style="text-align:center;color:blue;text-align:left" class="px k">1) Faliing Wedge</h4>
			
			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/Falling-Wedge.png" alt="falling-wedge" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			
			
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falling wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes lower lows and lower highs with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in a downward trend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates the downtrend is losing steam. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a bullish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the downward trend is losing strength and the resumption of the uptrend is in the making.

				In a falling wedge, both boundary lines slant down from left to right. The upper descends at a steeper angle than the lower line. Volume keeps on diminishing and trading activity slows down due to narrowing prices. There comes the breaking point, and trading activity after the breakout differs. Once prices move out of the specific boundary lines of a falling wedge, they are more likely to move sideways and saucer-out before they resume the basic trend.</p>
	
			<p style="text-align:center" class="px k"><strong>Double Top</strong></p>

			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/double-top.png" alt="double-top" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double top is a frequent price formation at the end of a bull market. It appears as two consecutive peaks of approximately the same price on a price-versus-time chart of a market. The two peaks are separated by a minimum in price, a valley. The price level of this minimum is called the neck line of the formation. The formation is completed and confirmed when the price falls below the neck line, indicating that further price decline is imminent or highly likely.

				The double top pattern shows that demand is outpacing supply (buyers predominate) up to the first top, causing prices to rise. The supply-demand balance then reverses; supply outpaces demand (sellers predominate), causing prices to fall. After a price valley, buyers again predominate and prices rise. If traders see that prices are not pushing past their level at the first top, sellers may again prevail, lowering prices and causing a double top to form. It is generally regarded as a bearish signal if prices drop below the neck line.
				
				The time between the two peaks is also a determining factor for the existence of a double top pattern. If the tops appear at the same level but are very close in time, then the probability is high that they are part of the consolidation and the trend will resume.
				
				Volume is another indicator for interpreting this formation. Price reaches the first peak on increased volume then falls down the valley with low volume. Another attempt on the rally up to the second peak should be on a lower volume.</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:center" class="px k"><strong>Double Bottom</strong></p>
			
			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/double-bottom.png" alt="double-bottom" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			


			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A double bottom is the end formation in a declining market. It is identical to the double top, except for the inverse relationship in price. The pattern is formed by two price minima separated by local peak defining the neck line. The formation is completed and confirmed when the price rises above the neck line, indicating that further price rise is imminent or highly likely. Most of the rules that are associated with double top formation also apply to the double bottom pattern. Volume should show a marked increase on the rally up while prices are flat at the second bottom.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bullish reversal pattern where the price holds a low two times and eventually continues with a higher high. Similarly to the double top, the bounce between the two lows should be moderate. The pattern is confirmed once the price reaches a higher high than the top of the bounce between the two lows. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double tops and double bottoms are patterns that occur when the market moves in either an “M” or a “W” shape. It’s worth noting that these patterns may be valid even if the relevant price points aren’t exactly the same but close to each other.Typically, the two low or high points should be accompanied by higher&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/volume" target="_blank">volume</a>&nbsp;than the rest of the pattern.</p><br>

			
			
			<p style="text-align:center" class="px k"><strong>Head and Shoulders / Inverse Head and Shoulders</strong></p>
			

			<img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/head-and-shoulders.png" alt="head-and-shoulders" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the head and shoulders pattern occurs within an uptrend, the pattern starts with the price rising and then pulling back (lower), forming the left shoulder. The price rallies again, creating a higher peak, which is known as the peak of the head. The price moves lower once again, and then rallies into a lower peak, forming the right shoulder. When the price drops following the left shoulder and the head, these are called swing lows. Connecting the swing lows with a trendline, extended off to the right, forms a “neckline”. When the price falls below the neckline, the pattern is considered complete and the price is likely to continue moving lower.</p><br>

			
			
			<figure><img class="center radius-border" src="../mypage/images/inverse-head-and-shoulders.png" alt="inverse-head-and-shoulders" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></figure>
			
			
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head and shoulders is a bearish reversal pattern with a baseline (neckline) and three peaks. The two lateral peaks should roughly be at the same price level, while the middle peak should be higher than the other two. The pattern is confirmed once the price breaches the neckline support. </p>
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the name suggests, this is the opposite of the head and shoulders and as such, it indicates a bullish reversal. An inverse head and shoulders is formed when the price falls to a lower low in a downtrend, then bounces and finds&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/support" target="_blank">support</a>&nbsp;at roughly the same level as the first low. The pattern is confirmed once the price breaches the neckline resistance and continues higher.</p>
			
			
			<p class="px k">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classical chart patterns are among the most well-known&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-technical-analysis" target="_blank">TA</a>&nbsp;patterns.
