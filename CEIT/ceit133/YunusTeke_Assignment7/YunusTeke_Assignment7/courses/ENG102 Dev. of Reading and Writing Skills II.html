        Course Description <br><br>
        With a particular emphasis on academic research and speaking, English for Academic Purposes II recycles and builds on the skills of academic writing, critical analysis and organization that were introduced in the pre-requisite course English for Academic Purposes I. The course introduces the key concepts of reliable academic research and information literacy, exposes students to authentic academic materials in written, oral and visual formats, and thereby has the ultimate aim of helping learners become more autonomous and resourceful in their academic studies. Classwork of ENG 102 involves close reading and analysis of the source texts, followed by class discussions, which requires deep understanding and evaluation of and reaction to the materials. </p1>
