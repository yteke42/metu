    "# Practical Example: Add Context for a Large Language Model (LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you’ll get hands-on experience using ChromaDB to provide context to OpenAI’s ChatGPT LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the scene, you’re a data scientist who works for a large car dealership. The dealership has sold hundreds of thousands of cars and received many reviews. Your stakeholders would like you to create a system that summarizes different types of car reviews. They’ll use these summaries to improve marketing and prevent poor customer experiences in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re responsible for designing and implementing the back-end logic that creates these summaries. You’ll take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a ChromaDB collection that stores car reviews along with associated metadata.\n",
    "* Create a system that accepts a query, finds semantically similar documents, and uses the similar documents as context to an LLM. The LLM will use the documents to answer the question posed in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of retrieving relevant documents and using them as context for a generative model is known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This allows LLMs to make inferences using information that wasn’t included in their training dataset, and this is the most common way to apply ChromaDB in LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of factors and variations to consider when implementing a RAG system, but for this example, you’ll only need to know the fundamentals. Here’s what a RAG system might look like with ChromaDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"rag.avif\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "You first embed and store your documents in a ChromaDB collection. In this example, those documents are car reviews. You then run a query like **find and summarize the best car reviews** through ChromaDB to find semantically relevant documents, and you pass the query and relevant documents to an LLM to generate a context-informed response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is that the LLM takes both the original query and the relevant documents as input, allowing it to generate a meaningful response that it wouldn’t be able to create without the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, your deliverable for this project would likely be a chatbot that stakeholders use to ask questions about car reviews through a user interface. While building a full-fledged chatbot is beyond the scope of this tutorial, in later modules you will learn **LangChain** that are designed specifically to help you assemble LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this example is for you to see how you can use ChromaDB for RAG. This practical knowledge will help reduce the learning curve for LangChain."

    "\n",
    "Once you’ve downloaded the dataset, unzip the file and store the data in your project directory inside a subdirectory called `data/`. There’s one CSV file per car, and you should store all of them within `data/archive/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, you can take a look at the dataset using Polars, a popular DataFrame library. Make sure that you have Polars installed in your environment using Shell or Terminal: `python -m pip install polars`\n",

       "  ' I just leased a new 2017 Acura ILX two months ago. This was the seventh Acura I\\'ve owned or leased, beginning with the 5 cylinder Vigor many years ago. I loved each and every one of these cars...except this one. I HATE it. There should be a warning sign on these- \"Watch out! Buy this if you\\'re a dummy.\" The \"new\" 8 gear transmission, with two clutches, is way too complex and does not offer performance as Acura bills it. The car hunts for gears as you accelerate, and has very little power from 10mph to 40 mph when you are accelerating. The car lugs in the lower gears. My previous car, a 2014 Acura ILX was perfection itself. I should have kept it. The most annoying aspect of this new car? The muffler. Acura is apparently ignoring its traditional (loyal) adult audience and seeking to attract new users that are young men in their 20\\'s. So they have \"boosted\" the HP, but this is not accurate. The car is much less powerful than before, despite the claims for higher HP. And it is supposed to be thriftier on gas, but so far (I now have a little under 2000 miles) it is not as much of a gas-saver as was my 2014 Acura ILX.  The worst thing? The muffler. It is noisy as all get-out. I suppose this was to attract those young males. I would do anything to get a different muffler that is quiet. I do not wish to hear the constant \"throaty growl\" Acura has decided is necessary.  I keep thinking 33 tortured months to go...Arrgh.',\n",
       "  ' Unlike almost all auto companies in the class that Acura tries to compare itself to, Acura does not, under any circumstances, permit a lease to be assumed, regardless of circumstances. And when you approach the dealer to see if a buyback is a potential solution, they tell you that the car is worth far less than the amount of payments due..... Its a sham..... Do not EVER lease an Acura.....',\n",
       "  \" I have owned two previous Acura's and loved them.  This vehicle is poorly made.  I had 18 things wrong with it, and the dealership and Acura customer service were unwilling to assist me.  What a way to treat a loyal customer!  Do not waste your time or money!!!   Traded it in for a Lexus!!!\",\n",
       "  ' I was a proud owner of the 2004 Acura TL.  Loved that car.  I had to buy another Acura thinking the car would make me just a happy.  That didn\\'t happen.  The transmission doesn\\'t know where it is.  It bangs and knocks and when you left off the gas it feels like you are lunging forward.  They say that the banging noise is \"normal\".  I was told that I was confusing the car when I drove it.  After all, it\\'s a sensitive transmission.  What a piece of junk.  It\\'s a hard ride and very noisy as well.  They cut every corner they could on this car and it shows.  They didn\\'t cut the price either.  What is standard options on so many other cars now, you pay dearly for on an Acura.  I will never, ever purchase another Acura.  Never!',\n",
       "  \" Do not buy this car, save money and buy something else. Car makes lot of noise when driving and when gear change. GPS and Voice controls are garbage totally unusable. you won't find 90% of address. Voice controls are a joke. New vehicle sounds and feels different then a vehicle with 1000 miles. Vehicle mileage is worst, city mileage and highway mileage is very bad.  DO NOT BUY THIS Car\",\n",
       "  ' My brand new MDX almost killed me yesterday. It drove jerky from day one. It is not just \"me getting used to a 9-speed transmission\" like the dealer is telling me. It does shift jerky and frequently slows down independent of what I am doing on the gas or brake. Will occasionally jerk strongly and repeatedly like it is about to stall when driving 35mph for several miles with no need for gears to shift at all. I took it back to dealer within 2-3 weeks of purchase. They claimed could find nothing wrong. It continued as before and before I could get back to the dealer a week or so later this happened: Stuck in stop and go highway traffic for half hour. Every press on the gas was herky jerky but suddenly when traffic finally started to move freely, a press on the gas produced nothing but RPM\\'s revving. I took my foot off the gas and tried again 2-3 times. I put on my flashers and barely rolled to the shoulder through the swerving traffic. I turned off the car and restarted to make my way jerkily back home. Second trip to dealer is so far producing the same bs that they can find no problem. I just found several stories online of same problem. Unless they fix this I am not driving this death machine.',\n",
       "  ' I have bought an ILX July last year and in January they transmission broke! February they had to replace the battery twice, in March they had to replace the starter... and today the car would not start. I have been trying to talk to Acura saying that the car it\\'s beyond repair and that I don\\'t need a buy back, only give me car that is not a \"lemon\"... the case manager keep saying that he is trying something but cannot garantee anything!! So I would not recommend anyone to buy an acura, specially ILX.',\n",
       "  ' I purchased a new, 2017 MDX SH AWD with technology package in February 2018 from Frankel Acura in Maryland and this has been my experience:  The salesperson, Mark was helpful.  The car had 378 miles on it when I purchased it.  Immediately after driving off the lot, I noticed the timing of the transmission seemed to be off. I was pressing the gas, however the car was hesitating and then it would shift into 1st or 2nd gear, but the shifting was rough, enough to jerk you forward when the car finally moved.  When I took the car to Frankel Acura for diagnostics and repair, I was told the vehicle was operating properly. I was also told that I would have to deal with the issue until Acura issued a software update for the transmission.  The dealership offered no further action regarding the transmission. I was also  told that once the car learned my driving habits, the transmission shifting might get better. Needless to say, I am disappointed in the performance of the vehicle and the dealership.',\n",
       "  ' I owned a Toyota sequoia prior to buying Acura. The handling of the car is excellent, especially cornering. However, the technology is half-baked. Whenever I am going from higher ground to lower ground the collision avoidance system kicks in. The collision system even kicks in when I make a turn and there is another car making a turn from the opposite side.The memory seat systems and folding mirrors works sometimes and sometimes not. Very frustrating!The Aha audio and Pandora doesn’t work. Replying to text through the entertainment system doesn’t work either. It is as if the manufacturers never tested the car!I am definitely going back to Toyota or Lexus. Very disappointed. I called acura in car tech and they always blame Apple. what a shame!!! ',\n",

Took it to one of the local dealers. I had to leave my CPO(!!!) car there for 14 days for Torque Converter replacement. Done. The tapping noise is gone. Great. ... Now I got a few new problems: 1. Upshifting hesitation  @ 20 mph.  2. Rough downshifting @ 20 mph. 3. Feel a jerk just before it comes to a complete stop. Will take it back to them next week. As soon as I got out from the dealer decided to check on their work...oh my... Drivers side mirror scratched, plastic engine cover under the hood was not secured- just left loose on the engine, 4 plastic clips are missing on under-the-hood panels.

This disfunction is going to hurt Acura and future sales.\",\n",
       "  \" We leased a fully loaded Acura RDX and are very disappointed. There is a clear design defect that Acura dealers deny even knowing about. When driving the side view mirrors show a glare from  the air conditioning vents. This is because the vents contain a silver metal design and the sun shows the glare on the side view window. It is more than annoying and is a distraction. When we called the dealers, they claim not to know about it. We even spent money to tint windows, but this failed to help. In calling around to other dealers, we contacted one out of state who acknowledged it was an issue. This dealer said they were changing the vents by inserting a black rim in place of the silver one. Thus, you can now enjoy a far lower priced Honda instead of an Acura!!!  Calls to Acura customer service have not been returned as promised. Also, my wife's foot cramps when driving because the pedals are too high. Others have complained about it according to another dealer I spoke with. The Navigation is cumbersome, difficult and voice recognition is terrible. It is hit and miss unless you always want the date. Any other info? forget it. I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone and am surprised that Acura hides these issues. I will try to get out of my lease because of these issues.\",\n",

My daughter has a 2008 and it has served her well for reliability and longevity and safety and is much more comfortable seats than mine.  Having the cooling system in it makes the seats harder and smaller. No this is not a car I would say you have to have. Very disappointing.',\n",
       "  ' I am the owner of a 2006 Acura TL, and I must say that it is the best car I have ever owner for $27k, but it is getting old.  So I went to Acura to look at the new 2017 TLX, which is the TL replacement.  What an embarrassment to quality for a $40k car.  Interior is cheap plastic instead the softer leather/vinyl found in my TL.  Headroom in the back seat will only accommodate a person 5\\'8\" tall or shorter.  I am 6\\' tall and I had to tilt my head and sink down in the seat to fit.  Seats are leather trim instead of all leather which usually means that 80% of the seat is vinyl with a little bit of leather to fool people.  Front dash with speedometer and odometer looks very cheap.  Bottom line, this car looks comparable to a Honda Civic, which is what the ILX is suppose to do.  Now for the safety part.  THIS CAR DOESN\\'T COME STANDARD WITH A SPARE TIRE IN THE TRUNK.  Acura gives you a can of sealant  which more than likely WILL NOT fix your flat tire so that you can get off the highway and drive to a safe area.  So get AAA.  But what the sealant will do is wreck your TPMS sensor inside the tire which will cost a couple hundred dollars to replace.  Electronic assisted steering means that at any time you are driving your car, the steering will fail and take you into the woods or down an embankment.  Scary, isn\\'t it.  If you are driving down the highway and you are in danger of hitting a car or deer that is in front of you, your natural instinct is to brake and veer onto the shoulder of the road to avoid a collision.  Acura\\'s new Lane Keeping Assist system will sense that you are going off the paved road and pull you back onto the highway so that you smash into whatever you were trying to avoid.  The bottom line is that Acura has no replacement for the TL.  Now I know what you are going to say, \"What about the RLX?\"  Well, the RLX is an old person sedan that my dad would drive and costs twice the amount that I paid for my TL for roughly the same quality of car.  Personally I think that Acura needs a new CEO who can bring back luxury and quality to the low-end Acura line without costing the consumer over $60k.',\n",
       "  \" Generally I like the vehicle, but IPhone phonebook does not download and it is evident that there is no solution.  Support from the dealer and Acura is  empathetic. The response I get from both is that Apple IOS updates are too frequent and Acura cannot react in a timely manner with a compatible fix for the A-Link system. Whatever the excuse, the feature is flawed. It is upsetting that the dealer knew connectivity was an issue as the salesperson said you can use Siri to access your address book, but did not tell the rest of the story.  MDX owners all paid for a hands free phone feature with voice activation, a common feature even in economy cars today that promotes safe driving. Acura, along with the dealer network, knew the problem existed and were glad to charge for the feature.  So what about resale value? Would you buy this car with this sort of defect?  All that said, I like most everything else about the car so I'm close to being a satisfied customer.  Waiting to see what Acura will do to resolve the issue.\",\n",

I have driven four TLX V6 AWD from dealer, every of them vibrates.  My neighbor has a  TLX AWD V6 with tech package too, his car vibrates around 75 MPH too.  This time Acura made very bad car.

I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this car and the regret I feel for spending this much money on a car with so many flaws I can't begin to explain them all.  The dashboard technology is so ridiculously behind and out of sync with other brands but of course I didn't realize how bad until after I owned the car and had a chance to deal with it on a daily basis.  Just an example is turning on heated seats requires pressing a button on the touch screen then selecting again a level of choice.  If you want to change it again that same two steps is required each and every time. I get so frustrated with how ridiculous this is when you think about safety and distracted driving.  If you use voice control it's the same two step process if it recognizes what you are saying.  The car is completely gutless and unresponsive and I don't drive it the same as my 2010 TL because I can't.  I'm discouraged I spent so much money on this car when the manufacturer hasn't corrected the past problems with their brand and went cheap by not updating and keeping current with technology offered by other auto makers in the same class.  Some things in this car just don't make sense and you won't know it until you drive it for awhile.\",\n",

I contacted client relations and they said they can't change the design at this point and nothing they can do. So,  if quality is what you like perhpas you should take a 2nd look at the fuel door. I am very disapointed with the answer from Acura client Relations. I connected with 80+ 2017 Acura MDX Owners on Facebook and several others stated a similar problem. Acura has not bothered to notice these social posts but they don't hesitate to solicit new owners for feedback on the quality of the car. I reply to all the surveys and restated my issue.

The firmness factor is unbearable for any drive over 30 minutes. Not suitable for a 6 ft person.  The Technology is total mess.

Way overpriced for this awful level of refinement. The pilot and odessey have both abandoned the two display infotainment system along with the rest of the industry..Update..basically reaffirm the above but I would add the 2018 finally added CarPlay but the goofy two display has not yet caught up to the Pilot and the depreciation is far beyond disappointing.

Then stepping on the gas at a green light and be careful you don’t smash into the car in front of you as the car stumbles into 1st gear and jerks and shoots you forward into second. Then second jerks the car into third. It’s absolutely horrible and very frustrating. I leased this car brand new in December and took it to the dealer two days ago in March.

Acura is supposed to be a luxury brand but from my experience with them vs my experience with Mercedes, Lexus, bmw, and Cadillac. Acura has a lot to learn about being a luxury brand.

My only minor complaint is the passenger window occasionally goes down about a half inch on its own. I notice because it rattles. I don't know why it dies this- almost like road bumps rattle it loose. I switch between regular and premium gas and notice no difference in mpg. Car feels like it runs better on premium but not enough to justify the 70 cents + per gallon difference. Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.\",\n",

The vehicle is pretty much top notch in all categories but it doesn't necessarily scream luxury on the inside.  It is definitely very well appointed but I was hoping for just a bit more of a luxurious feeling on the inside.  That's the negative I knew about and purchased the car anyway.  The other negative about this vehicle is the clunkiness of the technology (which I guess if I'd test driven it for more than 15 minutes I might have eventually discovered) and the fact that the iPhone connectivity is poor (which I didn't know until after the fact).  All menu and sub-menu options are toggled to and selected via a main dial that's about as big as the channel dial on a very old television, and there's a small bit of lag between pressing/turning the dial and the system responding.  In addition, and even more bothersome, is the fact that iphone contacts do not seamlessly synchronize via Bluetooth.  I have hundreds of contacts in my phone, and only about 5 of them synchronize.  After wondering what the heck I was doing wrong because I just couldn't get my contacts to synchronize - in addition to the voice command system not properly recognizing prompts - I turned to Google and, alas, found forum after forum of other MDXers complaining about this very same issue for years now.  In the end, I'd still probably have purchased this vehicle because it was the highest rated for safety in this vehicle class by IIHS and NHTSA, and safety is my number 1 criterion when I purchase a vehicle, but I might not have opted for the Tech package if I'd have been aware of these issues.  Another disappointment is the fact that the AcuraLink app doesn't have functionality to remotely start the car, yet it can remotely lock & unlock doors.  That ability/convenience would be a small luxury that would go a long way.\",\n",

I like the variable cylinder management that shuts off 3 cylinders during low output conditions.  It is such a smooth process you don't know when it is happening.  The technology interfaces are kind of old fashioned for an upper end vehicle.  No touch screens or fancy graphics.  Buttons and knobs are nicely laid out, but I wish fan speed was controlled by a knob instead of buttons.  Radio does not stay on after car shuts off.  Seats are comfy, but leatherette surfaces are more like plastic than leather.  Heated seats warm up fast, but I miss a heated steering wheel.  Elevated rear seats are nice with plenty of legroom.  Great visibility out rear and side windows.  The 19.5 gallon gas tank could be larger.   The AWD version comes with a spare tire instead of a tire repair kit.  Headlights look and function great.

But the transmission....... when the vehicle is cold, it slips into 4th gear.  It has from new and continued to get worse to the point the dealership replaced the transmission at 12,000.  After replacing, the same thing is occurring as it did when it was new.  So I anticipate in 12,000, if my attorney doesn't make Acura act more quickly, I'll be getting another transmission.  After agreeing to replace the transmission, Acura factory reps, now say it is normal.

       "  ' Feels like Honda literally sent Acura a civic LX and they \"pimped your ride\" with some leather and such. Back in 2007 with my first new Acura, the TSX was with navi or not, and came fully loaded with all the other features and was tons of fun to drive, especially in the twisties (mine was a 6 speed manual). Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you\\'re nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. \"Pleather\" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you\\'ll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days. If you want a touch screen entertainment system you\\'ll pony up $2,000 for the premium package and also get some nick-nack features like perforated leather and blind spot detection. If not you\\'re stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17\" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it\\'s trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it\\'s higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000. Truthfully it really is just a very comfortable, better looking Civic that you can lease for under $300 a month with $0 down, however, it may be the best thing you can get for that price in the luxury market.',\n",

It's comfortable, gets good mileage but isn't peppy.\",\n",
       "  \" I just got this recently, so I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I think that I have a pretty good idea of what this car is. Likes: the power and the price. Those were the two main factors that made me pull the trigger. They had a great lease deal and I really wanted a V6 instead of a turbo 4. Other cars I considered were the new Lexus RX350 (which was at least $150 more a month), the BMW X3 and the 3-series GT (probably $200 more a month, and their down payments are considerably more) and the Lexus NX 200t (smaller and turbo engine). The build quality is great. I got the base model with the leatherette seats and they feel very nice, other than the strong plastic smell. No sweet leather smell here. I like that this is lower than most SUVs, so it handles so much better and if feel almost like, dare I say, a sporty sedan. I had a Toyota Highlander before, and I wanted to avoid the dynamics of a heavy and soft SUV. . . It was a pregnant cow on wheels. The RDX's engine sounds sweet and pulls great -- the transmission, on the other hand, is slow and outdated. Forget using the paddle shifters, they are slow and there's a jerk when downshifting. Better just use your foot and/or sport mode and leave the paddles alone. This engine with modern 8-speed transmission would kill. Comfort is okay. Some people have complained about RDXs having suspension problems. The car doesn't like bumps. You can feel and hear the suspension working and I do think it's a design flaw, but not a defect per se. I did have suspension problem on a 2011 Honda Odyssey, and after multiple trips to the dealership and opening a case with corporate, they were never able to fix it. It's just like every other manufacturer, they have known problems with their car and they jerk you around until you give up. I personally like the simple entertainment system in this base model. Acura's technology package is outdated. I do wish the stereo was a bit better, but I can live with it. Bluetooth always pairs without fail with my iPhone 6. All in all, this is a great small SUV if you want acceleration, a bit of luxury, decent cargo space, and a low price. I think that naturally aspirated V6s are a dying breed, and by the time this lease is up, I'd probably be faced with choosing a 4-cyl turbo, or some type of hybrid system -- which I guess wouldn't be that bad. So far I'm getting 18 mpg (90% city traffic), and that combined with a smallish fuel tank has me going to the pump more frequently than I'd prefer.\",\n",

Such as unlocking all doors when unlocking one, the passenger seat only has 4-way adjustment.  The acceleration is good, and it has the power I need.  I was driving a $60k Audi Q5 as a loaner before I got the Acura RDX, and that was an amazing car, but I didn't have $60k to spend on a car, for the price difference (I paid $34,000) it is a great option.*Update - my review above is still accurate.

I have teens that are now driving themselves and I don't need a third row however the middle row captain chairs make the MDX functionally a 4 person vehicle which was a negative to me.

The stereo is the known ELS which is very good. The bad news: The technology is archaic, behind the times, totally disappointing, head scratching, how ACURA allows their automobiles to be designed and sold this way. The Honda Civic and the Hyundai Elantra (!!) are years ahead in terms of technology than the TLX. The menu selections are awful, a lot of duplication. The response time is amazingly slow, to the point that one does not know whether it works. The software did get \"hung up\" once, during the first week but it recovered.

Well, it was replaced and it looks just as bad. I am relying on good old fashion eyeballs to back this car into parking. Very disappointed and frankly surprised that Acura would install such a \"behind the times\" old technology blurry camera from another decade into this high end car. I have had other cars that cost less and their cameras are far more superior and way sharper then this one. Fix the problem or recall it Acura!!! Its dangerous to rely on your blurry camera to back up. Its a lawsuit waiting to happen.

I was between getting another Passat, Infiniti Q50, or this car. What won out was the interior quality and looks of the TLX. The Q50 trunk was way too small and interior very tight for my 6\\'2\" frame. I would have got another VW , but thought I needed to look at something different. The things that I find frustrating on this car are the complicated radio, the Sirius only presets 12 channels, and you can\\'t see what song is on Sirius until you turn the channel.

The biggest difference is this is the little brother to the MDX and does not have the 3rd row of seats and thus less cargo space as well. I didn't need the space and welcomed the smaller SUV with better gas mileage! If I have any complaint at all it is that the front driver seats appears to be much smaller than the one that was in my 2012 MDX. It has been taking me awhile to get used to it. The bigger MDX seemed to have more support particularly with a bigger seat body that went up to the back of my knees. Other than that the car is fantastic.

All wheel steering, handles great and I really like to drive it in Sport Mode.  2018's have much better looks, exhaust integrated panel that is not connected to exhaust but it looks great...the grill just looks updated from previous generations.  The TLX is wide and therefore doesn't feel like a small car, but it is noticeably shorter than first generation and the previous generation (2009-13) which were more stylish than 2017.  $40 Grand to buy is too much for this car, it just can't compete with BMW or Mercedes on status, if that is important.

       "  ' We were looking to replace my wife\\'s 2010 Pilot with something modern and a bit smaller (as we didn\\'t need as much space anymore). She wanted something with an interesting design, high quality and would be fun to drive. Kids asked for second row captain chairs with heating. 3-rd row would also be nice to have, since we occasionally need more than 4 people in a car. And finally, we needed an SUV comfortable enough to handle our long family trips. Besides comfortable seats, it had to have driver-assistance capabilities to reduce driver\\'s fatigue. The budget was around $65K. When we started putting together a list of models we wanted to check out, my wife mentioned that one BMW is more than enough for our garage (my 01\\' M-roadster), so she\\'d exclude x5/x6 right away. Over the course of 2 weekends of dealership visits, the following options were rejected: Cayenne (only 2-row seating, pricey fun-to-drive models), Macan (just too small), MB GLE (didn\\'t like overall philosophy), Jag F-pace (seating config, compromised rear-seat comfort due to its sedan-based platform), Model X (fabulous car, but way above the budget), Lexus RX (liked the interior and design, but non-heated and somewhat cramped 2-nd row). As such, MDX and Lexus GX were short-listed for test drives. Initially, we tested a gasoline version of MDX (sh-awd). My wife\\'s impression about it was \"safe and boring\". I think it\\'s because of the transmission on the gasoline model, which takes it\\'s time to decide which gear would be better to use right now, considering a few dozen of factors, which probably include speed, inclination, ambient temperature, recent driving pattern, weather on Mars etc. etc. All this, while you have a really small window in traffic to merge into. Our Pilot was way better in such cases. I asked the sales guy to call me when they get a hybrid version, since I knew it should behave differently in that sense. My wife was excited to test the GX because she preferred its design and interior, due to some reason. Her impression after driving it was: ok on a straight, but so horrible even in moderate curves that it wasn\\'t safe. We decided to wait for the hybrid MDX and keep the Pilot for another year or two in case we didn\\'t like it. When the test car arrived a few weeks later, it exceeded our expectations. For $1500 premium you get two major improvements over the gas AWD version: the Acura\\'s hybrid drive with dual-clutch transmission and the adaptive suspension. The former makes the acceleration faster and much smoother, while the latter allows configuring it for agility or comfort, depending on the situation. As a bonus, you get an outstanding fuel economy. With a bit of knowledge of how hybrids work, it\\'s easy to beat the EPA numbers by 1-2 mpg. If it\\'s not your thing and you prefer active driving style (like my wife), you will get the stated 26-27 mpg. At current gas prices, $1500 extra should pay back in 3-4 years with 12K miles per year. Considering all that, the only meaningful reason of going for a non-hybrid MDX I can think of is the budget limitation only enough to get a base FWD model. FWD Tech package and especially AWD Tech and above doesn\\'t make sense in a non-hybrid model.',\n",
       "  \" This is my 5th MDX- 2003, 06, 11, 16, 17. I had a 2016 w/Tech. Hated it!! Loved my others. The transmission and brakes were horrible!! I should have kept my 2011. But with the help of my dealer, I was able to trade in my leased 2016 for a 2017 Hybrid w/Advance. (I test drove it a month earlier when it was released to dealerships.) Totally different vehicle! This hybrid is what I expected in a petrol MDX. The system is SUPER quiet and seamless. Actually have more power (torque wise) than my 2016. The technology of the Hybrid is nothing short of spectacular! Smooth, quiet, powerful, and informative. Has a cool information screen to tell u what system is working and which is charging the battery! The suspension and brakes are also different from the standard MDX. Much smoother with the adaptive dampers and the brake travel is firm with a short throw. When having my Hybrid accessorized I had a MDX w/Advance loaner. Now I could actually do a comparison. Unfortunately it drove like my 2016 with the exception of stop/start feature which was an annoyance. In the Hybrid, the system works the same way EXCEPT when u accelerate you are actually on electric motors THEN the motor starts seamlessly. By the way it doesn't use a conventional starter! The front electric motor IS the starter! How cool is that. AND when driving you would never know when the engine is on or off unless you are looking at the tachometer! Even when you initially start the vehicle you can barely hear it. And the gas mileage is EXACTLY as advertised- 26.6 city/27-28 highway so far. I cannot see anyone who tests drives BOTH vehicles to not go with the Hybrid. It's only $1500 more than a comparable equipped MDX. The best bargain I have ever seen for this much technology (and I am a tech guy)! Out of the 21 vehicles I have owned since 1965 this by far the BEST vehicle I have ever had!! And that includes 2 sports cars that I loved!! Only one real drawback, Acura is no longer including a spare tire kit so I had to purchase one. One day Acura may only be making Hybrids (so far RLX, NSX, MDX). But for a newly introduced vehicle to the market, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!\",\n",

Pros: Hit the gas (or should it be called the hybrid) pedal and it flies off the line.  Quietest interior I've ever been in.  Steering is tight and responsive.  My kids are big fans of the second row captain's chairs.  Driver's assisting safety features (lane departure, etc.) seem top notch.  Interior features (seats, wood accents) are very nice.  Averaging 26.6 MPG so far.  Cons: not a fan of the infotainment system.  Miss the old buttons for heating and cooling seats.  Takes too long (IMHO) for rear view camera to kick in.  Had to wait over a minute yesterday for navigation menu to activate - not a big deal unless you're running late like I was.  A few minor things I'll have to get used to.

The 9 speed takes a second and a half to down shift but after that it just goes through the gears.  Finished rear end similar to what is on Mercedes, a great touch.  Don't especially like the leather or shall we say 'fake-leather' interior.  Not good, and between the transmission and fake leather had to take a point off the 5 star rating.  Great paint and nice chrome accents that 2015 didn't have.  Not terrific in the snow, tires are touring, main culprit.  Nice looking grill-another reason I traded in '15 for '17.

She was coming from an Infiniti G37, so was used to great acceleration. The RDX doesn't disappoint as it's one of the quickest vehicles in it's class. The only complaints would be average to below average navigation system and lack of power folding mirrors, panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel, backseat climate controls, and Android Auto / Apple Car Play. The car excels in just about every other area. The Modern Steel Metallic with Graystone interior is gorgeous. Averaging 23 mpg around town.3-26-18 Update: 18,000 miles later,My wife still loves the car as much as Day 1. Still zero issues with the RDX. Only complaint is really the outdated and slow navigation system.\",\n",
       "  \" I was looking for a vehicle to replace my 2011 Lexus that had high mileage, and wanted a change.  The new Lexus is bigger than my previous Lexus and I did not want that large a vehicle.  I had test driven an Acura previously and went to the Acura dealer to check them out.  I love the design, I bought the RDX Advance, it is larger than the Acura I test drove 5 years ago, it is a great size for me.  It has a lot of bells and whistles' that is, technology features.  It is taking me a while to master them. But, I love the lane assist and blind spot warning, which takes no tech knowledge to operate.  I have only had the car 3 weeks, but so far, love it.  It drives so smoothly, with no noise.  The seats are very comfortable, great lumbar support.  I look forward to several years of great driving with this Acura RDX.\",\n",
       "  ' Recently got a 2017 sh-awd Advanced. Traded in our 13 Odyssey Elite. Powertrain seems good on the mdx and handling is great. Dashboard kind of cheap looking. Driver side front bumper don’t line up, rear bumper center sticking up to also touch hatch, fuel door sticks out and seems as if it’s not closing . I ended up removing the front and rear bumpers myself and found a few taps wasn’t locked in. I still need to figure out the fuel door issue. I could have taken it back to the dealer but didn’t want them to screw anything up.      Anyone with success with dealer correcting these issues?',\n",
       "  ' I owned a 2009 RDX with technology package and thought it was great. This one is even better. We had a 2012 BMW X3 for a short time but missed features of the RDX. We love our new RDX and because of the safety features the insurance is even cheaper than it was for the 2012 BMW.',\n",
       "  ' Lots of space in the back seat.  Wish it would have real leather seats!!!  Looks like leather but they are not real leather seats.',\n",
       "  ' Make sure the dealer covers all the extras (at extra cost) that you consider to be standard with the MDX and they are Not!  Very disappointing!',\n",
       "  ' I absolutely love my MDX! I researched a lot of vehicles before making this purchase and found the value, features, and interior space to be the best. I also know it will remain reliable for several years as is the Acura standard.',\n",
       "  ' We looked at the Acura MDX, Lexus RX-350/450H and the Audi Q5 and SQ5.  We spanned a total of 2.5 months of research, testing and outside, more thorough evaluations provided by Edmunds, Consumer\\'s Reports, Kelly Blue Book and the brand websites themselves.  We were thorough.  Edmunds and Kelly both list the Acura MDX as having the lowest Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) of the 3 brands we listed above.  That matters to us.  The reliability was also important since we were downsizing from 2 cars (2013 Infiniti G37X and a 2012 RX-350) to 1 and really needed to know what we would be relying on.  Stakes are high.  Re-sale values were also key to minimizing our total costs - so how the car looked and how well the interior/exterior matched as well as the prevalence of certain colors remaining from last year\\'s models told us what was selling and what wasn\\'t, so we avoided those that appeared to be lingering resulting from the public market\\'s taste and consequent purchasing behaviors.  How it went was this: Audi clearly has the performance edge, but the ratings for the Q5/SQ5 were not as good as the Q7, but the Q7 was too large for us.  The Q5 and SQ5 CR ratings and TCO of the Q5/SQ5 were not favorable to the MDX or Lexus, historically, however, they have invested for the 2018 line to improve it.  It is too soon for the data to say anything conclusive, except the performance was very good for the newly improved car.  Since the interior trims were too limited, we scratched Audi, not really knowing about the \"Sport\" mode available for the MDX at that decision point - the performance at high altitudes and climbing the I70 to over 11,000 feet on the way to where we live identified as a key metric.  The Lexus was very good and we were used to its design and performance - it was powerful enough, and very quiet, about the right size.  Yet, the 3 Lexus dealerships we visited ( 1 was visited 4X) could not provide the inventory for us to compare the look of the exterior colors to the interior colors.  They were kind enough and very professional, but did not deliver on what we needed to see to compare.  Everything else remains Lexus quality - very good.  Enter Acura: Lowest TCO.  Yes, you can push a button on the center console and switch from \"Drive or Normal\" mode to \"Sport\" mode where the 9 gears are used slightly longer and higher up the RPM scale while the intake and exhaust valves are re-calibrated to descend into the combustion chambers slightly more for higher performance.  Off the line, it is not as fast as the Audi SQ5 ( 5.0 seconds to 60 MPH) but it does move much faster than the Lexus RX350 - RX450H (has the CVT transmission which really \"lags\" when you need to move yourself around busy traffic).  We decided to purchase from Mile High Acura in Denver since their Senior Sales Consultant - Matt Heintz - is a multiple award winning sales performer, yet is excellent of his product knowledge and integrative/non-presumptive of what you want.  He asks.  He provides.  He informs.  He went through the final transactions quickly, demonstrated the controls, introduced us to the maintenance shop management and we were on our way in under 2 hours.  On our way home, this is what Matt and the MDX did for us:Matt\\'s high competence was on full-power today while meeting our demanding schedule while between/during our client calls.I set the MDX to \"Sport\" mode to make our client dinner appointment in time in Breckenridge.  Driving through town and merging into fast traffic flows was easy, climbing the I70 to 11,000 feet going into the Eisenhower Tunnel was no problem.  Ha! I even passed by an Audi Q5 struggling to maintain speed.The blind spot tech, lane centering ( 3 gentle tugs) came in handy while driving in busy patterns followed by backing down our long driveway using the panoramic cameras made it easier.Our purchase has been validated on that drive alone.  Yesterday, we had business associates on a hike with us.  It started to snow.  I went back and got the MDX and set the 2 rear captains chairs to high heat.  The dirt road to get to the group was already covered with already-driven on hard snow pack and ice and pitched steeply downhill.  I left the car in \"Drive or Normal\" mode.  While taking it slow, the car did not slip or lose traction at all, while the dashboard indicators flashed a few times indicating the SH-AWD was actively compensating and channeling the torque/power to whichever wheel(s) were the best choice for traction and control, while going over a very irregular dirt road.  By the time I got to the group, all the seats were toasty - they thought it was \"AWESOME\" while climbing in.  My wife is very pleased with it and we both are still learning the tech of the car and how to set it all up, but it is intuitive once you get it set.  It does not distract you like the RX350/450H controls do while driving.  We have reason to be optimistic, perhaps you will find this thorough review and recommendations helpful.',\n",
       "  ' Love the fit and finish throughout the exterior and interior of the RDX.    I like that I can plug in my iPod and control it completely from the audio interface.  The interface, however, is far from intuitive and I\\'ve often had to pull over in order to work through several attempts to complete an action (One example: search for and play a single song then revert back to shuffle and play the entire collection).  The front doors close with a nice solid \"thunk\".  The rear doors seem very light and uninsulated.   The gas tank could be larger -- it\\'s 16 gallons which, with an average 23 mpg around town, gets me through about 380-400 miles before needing a refill.  Seems to come up way more quickly than my former car (a Buick Lacrosse that had a much larger tank and got slightly fewer mpg\\'s).  I appreciate the ease of entry, the controls and comfort of the driver\\'s seat, and the get-up-and-go when you hit the gas.  Love the car!',\n",
       "  ' HEAVY DISCOUNT ONTHE 2017, JUST BEFORE THE 2018 COMEOUT',\n",
       "  ' Really enjoy the RDX and compared to my brothers Lexus, it blows it out of the water.  Instrumentation is the only negative as it is very confusing and not easy to intuitively understand the functions.  The split screens are also confusing and should be combined into one screen and not the dual screen method as of now.  Ride, handling, safefy features such as lane departure and lane departure assist are outstanding!  So glad I decided on the RDX.',\n",
       "  ' Have had the RDX for about a month.  So far, nothing but 5 stars in all areas.',\n",
       "  ' We bought this SUV for my wife who travels at least 4 days a week out of town.  Her former Honda Accord Touring was nice, but left her tired and sore from the ride.  The MDX is totally different.  She arrives safely and comfy.  We love this ride.  The seats are very comfortable and made well.  It handles corners like on a rail.  It somehow detects turns and encourages outside wheels to travel faster the the others.',\n",
       "  \" I've had my RDX for a month and already have 2000 miles on it.  Overall, I love the car.  Very comfortable seats and ride, however, I've had a little difficulty finding and ideal driving position.  I am very tall and with the seat all the way back to accommodate my legs, the steering wheel does not telescope quite far enough to be completely comfortable.  Many complain about the two screen technology but I like it very much.  I also own a Corvette so I like to go fast, and as a result I'm only averaging about 21 mpg around town, but that's fine with me since I had a Ford Explorer Sport before this and only got 17 mpg with that.  Overall, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this vehicle.  I really like the styling, with the door handles contoured to the belt line and the LED headlights.   I also like the clean back end with no bumper sticking out below the hatch and not visible exhaust tips (and yes I do like the four exhaust trumpets on my Vette).\",\n",
       "  ' I have been researching and shopping for a new vehicle for several months.  I had narrowed it down to the Acura RDX awd and Lexus NX and briefly thought about waiting until the new Honda CRV makes it\\'s debut next month. Well, I just pulled the trigger on the RDX with all the bells and whistles, and I couldn\\'t be happier.  It drives beautifully. It is quiet, responsive, and displays impressive handling.  Although the tech is probably of 2015 vintage (no apple car play or android auto), with ACC, LKAS, blind spot monitoring, collision mitigation, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, and stability control, I reallyb don\\'t feel that I am sacrificing anything. I have no problem with the double screen setup, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, I enjoy having the big map always being displayed on the upper screen.  The \"cherry\" on top was a killer deal I secured after visiting/communicating with multiple Acura dealers in the NY area. I strongly suggest that you do your due diligence.',\n",
       "  ' I went from a 2013 CRV and I love the 2017 RDX.  It has a nice quiet comfortable ride with plenty of leg room in front and back.  The V6 is very smooth and has some get up and go.  I love all the safety features in the advanced package.  I really like the navigation and being able to send destinations from your phone to your car navigation and calling Acura link to find a destination while driving.  The only thing lacking is there is no remote start option on the app and no heated steering wheel.',\n",
       "  ' I traded in a 2014 MDX because I got a great deal. The improvements in ride, navigation and interior comfort made it toatally worthwile. I really love this car. I just wish the Avdvance Pkg came with a 2nd row bench seat option, because I would have gone with that.',\n",
       "  \" Conducted extensive research on the RDX before I went to the dealership.  I scored an excellent deal and got the car that I wanted.  I agree with Edmunds review that it is quick to brake when there is plenty of space that does not require the over reaction.  Love the dual screen and while there is a learning curve on the navigation,  my phone app has a better navigation then what Acura provides.  Still.  It's not a deal breaker and I look forward to when I get to drive my car- which is a first for me.  Definitely a smooth, quiet ride.  And very comfortable on all fronts.  Just love it.\",\n",
       "  ' I\\'ve owned 2004, 2010 and now the 2017 Acura MDX.  The 2017 is an awesome car.  I looked at the Infinity QX60 and Audi Q7, and I thought the MDX drove the nicest and was the most comfortable.  The improvements between the 2010 and 2017 were many.   The handling is better, the seats are comfortable, the 4 captain  chairs are great,  the sun shield are handy,  the rear camera and views are very helpful.  I am averaging 27mpg (on the 2010 I averaged 18mpg)  I think the fit and finish is way better with the 2017 model.   The sensors work, almost too good.   I have noticed that when I\\'m driving back roads and have a sharp right turn and there is a vehicle is approaching at the turn, the \"brake\" sensor illuminates.   I do not mind the engine energy saving when at a complete stop, I\\'ve learned to anticipate when to let the foot off the brake to restart the car and continue on my way.  I was concerned about purchasing the MDX after reading some of the reviews here, and I\\'m so glad that made the decision to buy it.eUpdate:  I\\'ve owned the MDX for 9 months and have been able  to drive it in winter conditions.  The MDX handles Michigan winters flawlessly.  I appreciate the Auto Start to warm up the car before I get in it, the seats and steering wheel are warm and toasty when it below zero outside.  The 4 captains chairs available with the Advanced package have turned out to be great.  There is more room in the 2nd row since the chairs can be adjusted and I do not feel bad having a couple sit back there because of the ample leg room.  All in all, the MDX is a great car.  I will own it for years.',\n",
       "  \" Love, love, love it!  I buy and keep cars forever. My RDX AWD is a great pick. It is comfortable (given that I have RA) and very classy. It is quick and great in town and on road trips. The interior space is perfect with adequate storage space. Did I mention it is comfortable. The dealer Crown Acura in Clearwater, Fl was excellent to work with. Chris Duncanson made me very happy during the purchase process. Buy it!  You'll love it!\",\n",
       "  \" I owned a Lexus NXt200 for the last two years and have been a Lexus guy for 20 years. Still love their cars. However, I have been driving the  the RDX for the last two months and can definitively say it is far and away a better car than the NXt for my money. In short: the RDX interior feels more luxurious; acceleration is much smoother; car is quieter; and the technology such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure and blind spot monitoring make long trips much less stressful. You almost feel like you are a pilot monitoring a plane on auto pilot versus constantly turning cruise control on and off and fighting your way through traffic. It's more like you glide your way through traffic on the interstate. Of course, no car is perfect and there is still room for tweaks and improvements. For example, if you are on the interstate in the left lane and going around a long curve the car senses the the car ahead of you in the right lane is actually in front of you and slows down unnecessarily. But this is a rare and minor annoyance, especially compared the the raft of positive attributes this car possesses. I highly recommend you check it out during your due diligence period when shopping for a mid-size SUV. I am extremely happy I did.\",\n",
       "  \" It's been a long road till I pulled a triggered and leased 2017 base model AWD RDX. I also looked at BMW x1 & x3 and infinity Qx30 & QX50. Acura was a winner due to the best deal and dealership experience. I traded in my 2011 3 series that I loved but the CPO warranty was about to expire and I refuse to pay for fixing cars so in order to prevent it I decided to get a new car. I wanted awd because we go often to the mountains. I did not want the technology package because I hate having too many buttons and features even though I'm very computer savvy. I just assume that simple solutions are always the best. My fiancee got x3, retail price 10k more- it was a demo so its fully loaded but my car drives almost as nice as his and mine gets better gas milage even though his is 4 cylinder turbo. I got 22 freeway and 20 combined which is exactly the same as my beemer and better than my 2011 AWD Nissan Rogue! I consider that very good and I hope it will stay at this level (BTW unlike most people I do manual gas milage calculation every time I go to the gas station and don't rely on the computer readings because they are hardly ever accurate- beemer was most accurate). My other car option was x1 since I've always liked but it would cost me still more than Acura and it is a much more smaller car. RDX is equivalent of x3 and is a perfect size for me. Base model had keyless entry, moonroof , heated seat and back up camera which is all nice to have. The drive quality is very good, X3 has a better suspension but is also a stiffer ride due to run flat tires and bigger rims. I was very dissapointed with how much my 3 series depreciate during my 3 years of ownership that I'm not longer their loyal customer. They also stopped offering free brakes in the first 4 years of ownership which was another bummer. ON top of everything I think their cars are kind of outdated looking so its time for major overhaul. I might consider the x3 in 3 years if they come up with the nice design. Not that my Acura is a hot looking car because its super bland but the deal i got justifies it. The lease on Acura and Infinity was much cheaper for a very simple reason - Japanese cars don't depreciate as much as German cars. Anyway RDX is great car and the only downside is there will be  anew model coming up soon thats why I opted to lease. Highly recommended, safe and efficient vehicle.\",\n",

The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle.\",\n",

The LED lights are unreal and they fixed all the problems I did not like with the 2015 (no vents in rear, passenger seat that goes up and down, ...) Little stuff but they add up. This one even has ventilated seats (Cool)!!! But I do notice a difference in the ride. It feels heavier, more solid, more powerful, smoother. Once set up, the touch screen is great. I spent a long time looking and checking out ALL of the competition from Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Jaguar, Range Rover, Jeep, Subaru, ... Perhaps it is not the sportiest but it is just as fast without the noise as any of the others with their turbo 4's and it holds the road beautifully. And its roomy too!!

Why?  Well,....it depends on what you want.  I wanted Quality (I've always loved the way Acura's drive and last), Safety (NHTSA and IIS best ratings --with suite of safety features), Visibility (you can actually see out of the car and over your shoulder), Dependability (not one issue with it for over a year),  and Ease of Driving (the smoothest engine and most maneuverability I've come across), ---(btw, the steering IS very connected to the road and incredibly sporty for a large sedan).  Not to mention--- the roomy, rear seat, , the quiet cabin, the improved suspension, the way it climbs a hill and never downshifts, not to mention its' classic, elegant appearance.  The RLX is a fantastic vehicle and it's a shame that it doesn't get more love in the press.  Read reviews from actual owners!!  Test drive it yourself, and you'll be extremely surprised in the best possible way.  Pricing is high, but check around to get a good deal.  They are out there.

The biggest/best surprise is the SH-AWD (google torque vectoring if you haven't already) which makes the car a lot of fun to drive and adds a spare tire. The ELS sound system is great. The safety features should be standard on all vehicles -- the technology package adds the blind spot detection which is awesome. I was worried that the transmission would at least take some getting used to given the complaints but it's great actually. Their are plenty of YouTube videos explaining why it feels a little funny between 2 gears but I have honestly not had a problem in any IDS mode (sport, comfort, normal). The complaints don't seem to be primarily regarding reliability. I was also worried I wouldn't like the shifter after so many complaints. It is actually very easy to use and keeps me from ever having to look down. It has the added benefit of protecting you from changing gears when you shouldn't (i.e. P while driving, D while shutting off the engine, etc...) which ultimately saves wear on your transmission. Good warranty compared to the other SUVs (7 years on the drive train). The infotainment system is just ok even with the tech package but has all of the functionality I need. I wish that it had a panoramic sunroof. If you compare to other vehicles in the class, for example the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 etc.. or even the Pilot, Pathfinder, Highlander, and Forester, I thought the Acura was ultimately the best bang for your buck.\",\n",

When Acura announced 2017 clearance prices last month, I was able to get one for the same price as the loaded Edge. I have driven now for 3 weeks and I am very satisfied with my decision.

Anyway , the Pilot\\'s big bro MDX is a great vehicle. I have never seen my wife more happy with a car we ever owned, than with this. On the road its calm , serene and commands a presence of its own. If the  diamond grill and 22\" wheels don\\'t turn much heads, then the jewel eyes sure do it. It has a mind of its own even if you are feeling sleepy and it will tell you that by beeping every time you get too close to another car. Be it changing lanes or head on. Automatic braking is the most understated feature. Come to think of it, there have been times when I was driving another car and wished they had this one feature. Ample space for a family of 4 and spare seats for those once in 6 months or a year need for extra. Yes it comes with 2 memory sets of mirror and seating paired with 2 sets of keys. So when wife drives it mirror automatically set to her taste and when I do , it welcomes me with open arms and pre-adjusted seats and mirrors. Automatic liftgate, keyless car access and ambient lights give a feeling of luxury so does filling the gas tank with premium, only pinching , while drinking. That\\'s about the only pinch though. For buyers, with remorse, who would get a touring or elite younger brother, this gives a justified peace to its owner with the fact that its just couple of thousand more than the younger sibling. It also displays authority, with the body styling, shows seriousness, with 9 speed auto and means business when compared to the touring or elites, of which it claims none but possesses both.

       "  \" Overall, an excellent piece of engineering and design. It's not 100% perfect on design, but it's pretty darn close.  Let me summarize simply with Pro's and Con's. PRO'S are: Awesome handling with SH-AWD, I mean really awesome. Just about as good as my E92 M3, I totally mean that, for all intents and purposes on the street. The semi-autonomous driving features are great. The Lane Keeping system, the Adaptive Cruise Control with Follow, Blind spot warning, all make it ALOT safer to drive in these days of distracted driving. You must study the functionality of each system to know when you can and should not rely on them. But overall I find them productive and adding to safety for me and those around me. Comfort is 8.5 of 10. Seats are not super duper, but definitely more than acceptable. You can customize the crap out of all the systems, and if you read the 500 page manual like I did, you will be amazed at what this car can do. Walk away auto locking system is quite nice. WIth the right setup in the menu, you never, ever have to take the key out of your pocket/purse. Just walk in, walk out, the car does exactly what you want, when you want it, and you just never touch a button on the remote, EVER.  Worried about the car being locked? You can send it a message via your remote, querying the lock status, and I've tested that at 100 yards remote distance, no problem! Engine is satisfactory - it ain't a Porsche, BMW, but it gets the job done. The 9 spd tranny does fine! All these complaints about transmission hunting around for a gear, but I have not noticed it.  Auto engine stop awesome, auto brake hold system awesome. Headlights are freaking amazing, SO BRIGHT.  Sound system is 8.5/10. I have heard better, but this is totally fine. Mileage is pretty darn good, on a freeway going about 65  you can easily get 25mpg if not closer to 28-29mpg. CON'S: the navigation system sort of sucks, compared to Google Maps. You can't beat Google with it's machine learning and real-time mobile updates on traffic etc. Plus the processor powering the Nav and the Phone menus is slow and outdated. But usable if you have to. One huge con is for USB flash drives, the search functionality is AWFUL, as you can only scroll the huge list of songs or folders, you cannot search by Artist, Title, etc.... If you want to bring your own music, you better have a large iPOD, in which case the Search/Selection functionality is reasonable.  OVERALL: definitely a car you will enjoy taking road trips with.\",\n",

       "  \" My 2017 ILX, The day I was looking for a car. I scrambled from plenty of vehicles! First the Civic but to slow, Camry but no features, Rogue but too pricey, Sonata but too slow and expensive. Than I fell in love with my ILX, It was the best car I have driven out of all the four cars I listed. I drive 45 minutes from my house to Manhattan and it was saving me money and was a quiet and comfortable ride. I had a 2012 Passat SEL but I had so many problems and waste so much money that If I add all the maintenance prices plus the passat I could have boughten I Lexus or BMW, So I got the ILX. I had this for 2 years and no problems and at all. It's fast, reliable, fuel efficient and the money is worth it! My wife truly loves our ILX and I will hold on to it forever.\",\n",

       "  ' Update:  We are now 10 months into our ownership of this car.  Since then, two other family members have bought or leased new Acura SUVs based on our favorable experience.  We use the car quite a bit.  It will probably have around 23,000 miles by the end of our first yr of ownership.  We bought it certified pre-owned with about 3,000 miles already on it.  I still very strongly believe we bought the best and right car for us and our needs.  Haven\\'t had any repair needs.  I regret having the tires & wheels rotated - the car now has a very, very slight pull to it, which didn\\'t exist before the tire rotation.  With the car being 4WD, I should have been much less concerned about tire rotation.  Overall, though, this is just a great car.  Encourage you to read my further notes below, as I don\\'t have any revisions to my earlier comments.  Thank you Acura!We are about six months into our ownership of a \\'17 Acura RDX AWD with the Technology package.  We also strongly considered a Volvo V70 Cross Country, RAV4 Hybrid, and a Chevrolet Impala.  V70 doesn\\'t have near the rear seat leg room that the RDX has, which was important for us since we have taller teenagers.  Impala would have been a solid choice for us as well.  Also strongly considered a RAV4Hybrid; not sure you can tow anything behind it due to the hybrid drivetrain?  Definitely like the controls in the RDX - seem notably better than even those in the new MDX.  Upgraded stereo with HD radio was well worth it.  Very thankful for the generous cargo capacity behind the rear seats.  We had a hitch installed at the dealer.  Although the towing capacity is not high, it certainly expanded the usefulness of the vehicle.  This thing is truly a Sport Utility Vehicle in the best sense of the category.  The drivetrain is just awesome.  To get somewhere around 30 mpg on the highway with that amount of power available (and safety) is amazing.  Transmission shifts extremely smoothly.  If I could choose one upgrade for this car in the future, it would be for either an \"eco mode\" that shifts the transmission sooner, thus saving on gas, or an extra gear in the transmission for less consumption on the highway.  One other suggestion:  a buzzer should automatically sound immediately if the car is put into gear with the parking brake set.  There have been two instances where I put the car in reverse and started to back out of a parking space with the parking brake on.  I only got a few feet before the warning was sounded, but makes no sense why this warning wouldn\\'t take place sooner.  Another important point:  this car is made in the USA!',\n",
       "  \" When we decided to buy a new car we looked at the Honda Accord, Subaru Legacy and the ILX.  The Subaru had a lot of safety features but wasn't very attractive. Honda surprisingly didn't ride that smoothly and if I wanted all the bells and whistle was very pricey. We have a 2006 TL and it has been a great car so we decided to look at Acura and the last car we saw was the ILX and it was IT!  The ride was smooth and had much more power than I thought it would, it has all the bells and whistles I wanted and the safety features that Subaru has.  We were able to get the Tech Plus for a price lower than both the Honda and Subaru with the features we got.  I've had the car a couple of weeks and the gas mileage is great and I'm truly enjoying it.  I've had several people comment on how good looking the car is.  I see other reviews slamming this car but this  60 year old Nana with a snazzy red little car couldn't be happier.\",\n",
       "  \" If, after purchasing cars and Mini Vans based on family life and kids, and your looking for a Me, Myself & I ride that has grown-up features, style and luxury without purchasing a large sedan car, the Acura RDX SUV is a cross-over ride you'll simply fall in love with the moment you sit inside.   After much research, and having reached 41 years of  marriage, 3 very grown kids and 6 grandchildren (3 yrs. - 19 yrs of age), my desire was to purchase something that fit my active lifestyle without giving up the room and height I was accustomed to having.

Most modern vehicles have electric steering (ugh) and McPherson struts or something similar.  The double wishbone is gone for the most part.  HOWEVER, although this car is different, it is still a lot of fun to drive.  It handles extremely well with a lot of horsepower for its size.  The steering is good for electric and there is good feedback.  This is he first automatic I have owned in many decades of driving.  My advice: put it in sport mode, step on the gas and look for some winding roads.  You won\\'t regret it!March 2018.  It is 7 months on and there has not been a single problem with this vehicle.  It handles pretty well in the snow.  It handles well on wet pavement. It is nimble and very quick on dry pavement. I drive in comfort mode to commute and it responds very well when I need to merge into traffic.  CR rated the ride poor, but I don\\'t find it so.  I think it is perfect for a \"sport sedan\".  I\\'ve hit a few very bad potholes with no serious side effects. Two minor complaints: the armrests are too low and there is no dome light.  Otherwise, it is excellent.',\n",

We (truthfully my wife) were looking for a medium size SUV to replace our 2001 Honda Odyssey.  We test drove the RDX, Lexus RX 350, Nissan Murano, and a loaded out Honda CRV.  RDX was our first choice by a mile.  Super smooth power train and very quiet/smooth ride.  Easily best value in its class.  Back seat room is exceptional for two adults but three would definitely be a crowd.

       "  \" Honda is an engineering company first and foremost. Regardless of the product from rototillers to jet airplanes, whatever they make works and works well.  Yes, all cars break, some more than others, but for 40 years starting with Honda and then  Acura.  My last four Acuras never glitched once, same for my Hondas.  Moreover, you can judge a car company by how they handle recalls.  My last recall from Honda went perfect and was professionally fixed w/o a hassle.  For safety, reliability and style, I'll continue with Honda/Acura as long as their engineering and build remains excellent.  Lastly, resale is another consideration for owning a Honda product and to top it off, my RDX was made in the US.  That alone should be reason enough without even considering the lower cost to insure.\",\n",
       "  ' I purchased a very low mileage (less than 1,000 miles!) CPO AWD RDX Advance, had it shipped from out of state due to wanting Fathom Blue Pearl and none were available locally and Advance trim was even more difficult to find.  Traded in an Infiniti G37x due to needing more space but not wanting to sacrifice too much performance and I love the RDX more than I thought I would.  Very comfortable as a daily commuter and navigating through rush or driving hours on end up to the cabin.  I thought I really wanted a BMW X3 or Audi Q5 but after looking at maintenance expenses and higher insurance costs ($20-30$ more/month for the German cars and RDX is same as my G37) plus long term Honda reliability and resale value, RDX was an easy choice.  I drove all three SUVs in heavy snow storms (I live in Minneapolis) before purchasing which I highly recommend doing and despite the less sophisticated AWD system in the RDX, it performed just as well on both slick roads and unplowed parking lots as the X3 and Q5.  For those who do not know, the AWD system in the RDX was updated for the 2016 refresh with a larger rear differential, thicker drive shaft, and larger rear axle drive shafts to handle a 60/40 front/rear power split as well as provide better dry road handling.  The 2013-15 RDX can only manage a 75/25 power split and in testing another family members \\'13 RDX, the updated AWD system handles foul weather significantly better and the rear differential does not overheat as it does in the earlier models.  The RDX rides much softer than the X3 and the V6 is incredibly smooth and quiet.  A recent 1,000 mile road trip yielded 30.5mpg round trip so no disappointment there.  I thought my Infiniti was quiet on the highway but wow is the RDX hushed when cruising at 75mph.  Other reviewers said this car was noisy inside but I highly disagree as do the professional auto publications.  In comparison, I was disappointed by how much road and wind noise the BMW let into the cabin at highway speeds.  The seats are extremely comfortable (I am 5\\'7\"), ACC cruise control and lane keep assist work well, and the rear cross traffic alert is nice to have in busy parking lots.  ELS stereo has great sound quality and thump from the subwoofer and having both heated and cooled front seats is game changing.  I actually like the two screen setup and the NAV system will redirect you if there is a traffic incident.  I also like how it shows your next turn in the meter display along with the compass and other vehicle information.  My only gripe which I knew when buying this car is it a FWD platform with a transversely mounted motor and unequal length drive shafts so hard acceleration does bring just a slight, slight hint of torque steer but again, the updated AWD system does mitigate this compared to base FWD models and earlier production AWD RDX\\'s.  Otherwise, I really enjoy this car for its looks, features, and all around handling/daily livability.',\n",

What has followed in the past  few months is software updates, shifter change and brand new transmission but the critical issue remains.No complaints with dealership as they are merely third party to this end. The service staff is courteous and has maintained good communication with us all the way.But Alfa Romeo Corporate response is unbecoming of a premium brand. They moved our case to a Third Party Dispute Resolution Center, who offered us pennies as compensation for putting our lives at risk.A better and smarter company would have seen the seriousness of the situation and quickly replaced it with a new tested vehicle with matching or upgraded features. But our patience and positive approach has been met with indifference and lack of sense if urgency.We deeply regret buying this product from Alfa Romeo.

       "  \" I leased my Giulia about 1 month ago for 24 months and I am so glad I didn’t buy it. There are some really impressive things about the car. The performance/economy from the 2.0L intercooled/turbocharged engine; the handling, the sexy looks (I have metallic silver with red interior that really grabs attention). But, having lived with the car for about 700 miles, I already see things that make me glad I didn’t purchase this car. Performance/Mechanical: About that fuel economy… the trip computer on the instrument panel overestimates economy by about 7% (it says 33.5 MPG when it was really about 31.3 MPG). This isn’t that big a deal but my Mazda 3 (half this price) is within 0.2 MPG of reality. The sunroof on my car is currently inoperable. It did open once but now won't tilt, won't retract the interior screen back or anything. I’ve read one review where an online magazine said Alfa admits having some SW issues that contribute to engine and sunroof issues. The engine stop/start feature doesn’t have a hill holder so even on the slightest of inclines the car begins to roll backwards upon releasing the brake pedal – before the engine starts and engages transmission. That doesn’t happen in my BMW. Nice feature is the ability to lock the doors from the rear of the vehicle as you close the trunk (an extra button there). The engine has plenty of power, though when in advanced economy mode, if you punch the gas pedal while already rolling maybe 20 MPH, there is considerable lag until the car actually responds. I put the pedal to the floor and I have to believe it was a full second before the car accelerated at all. I’m not talking turbo lag here… I’m talking accelerator lag. The car just rolled along at the same speed for about 1 second before it even began to accelerate at all. Then it snapped our heads back and flew! Braking is sure footed and outstanding. One feels confident and in control – same with the steering for the most part. Suspension is the right blend of sportiness and softness such that you have confidence in control yet not too firm that the smallest bumps jar you. Transmission shifts seamlessly and almost imperceptibly. Alfa’s recommended service intervals are at 10,000 miles and they are now providing a free first service. So, with my 24 month, 20,000 mile lease, I won’t pay for anything except gas. A word of warning, they did tell me the first service would be $900 if it wasn’t free for me. That seems a little steep to change the oil and “check” things like tires, etc. Interior/Fit & Finish: The “B” pillar is very large and obtrusive and makes it difficult to do a head check over one’s left shoulder. All I see is B pillar and seat belt. Looking at my other vehicles (Kia, Nissan, Mazda, BMW), it seems this Alfa pillar juts out into the passenger compartment much further. Not sure if this is for the seat belt assembly but my other cars have adjustable height (this one doesn’t) and they do not protrude as much from the frame as this one. The main dial for the infotainment options is right near the shift selector and arm rest. It is VERY easy to tap this accidentally and that will create various distractions depending on which infotainment option you are currently using. For example, in Nav mode, it brings up the destination selection/cancel while in use. You then have to dismiss the route cancel by selecting again. Speaking of the Nav system… its’ pretty elementary. In fact, I compare it to a 2005 vintage Tom Tom system. While it boots up quickly, it takes a long time to replan routes (if you miss a turn, for example) and it seems to remain fixated on going the original way it wanted you to go even if, based on your missed turn, a new way is shorter. I have tried using “most economical”, “fastest” and “shortest” and I can’t make sense out of some of the routes it gives me. A route I travel frequently (having used Google maps and GPS within my other cars) resulted in this system continually trying to tell me to turn off the expressway I was on to take some other route. There is no shorter, faster or more economical route than what I was taking. I may drive that some weekend just to see where it wanted me to go but I sure can’t figure it out. Now I doubt it’s capabilities if I’m ever anywhere where I don’t really know what I’m doing. Also, I haven’t found a way to store a recent or current destination as a favorite. You have to enter each favorite in manually as if entering a destination. AC blows REALLY cold air and cools the car down fast! However, even on low speeds the fan noise is excessive – like a budget car. I expect more for north of $40K. I haven’t driven more than about 2 hours in any single day yet so I can’t really speak to long duration driving comfort but with the 8 way power driver and passenger seat, I expect a comfortable position can be maintained. The touch of the fabrics and the feel of the interior is as expected. Overall glad I'm leasing but will enjoy my 23 remaining months.\",\n",

The tech package is very simple, but it works really well and takes no time to master.  My guess is while it's more basic it's probably going to be better than most systems that they try to force too many features in and they are glitchy. Slam on the breaks and the car stays flat, zero noise drive.  The quality is top notch, not single defect or rattle. Only had it for a few weeks - really hoping the reliability is there too.

I read it twice and knowing the car and the rules these stories are a bit far fetched at least the one where they are so afraid to drive the car because the brakes failed and the dealership said there was not a problem with the brakes.  I guess they need to apply pressure to the brake peddle. For the car going into neutral on its own I would say the shifter is tricky for the newbie.

       "  \" My first Alfa. Coming from a string of Germans and one boring Asian luxury experience. This is likely the smallest sedan I've owned, yet seems to be sufficiently roomy as a daily driver. The drive is what this car is about. It is so light, responsive, and eager to turn, that I find gravitating toward it much more often rather then 3 other vehicles we have access to. Exterior is ok. Distinctive, without flashy. Interior (mine is red) is stunning even in base model. Base seats are average - should've gone for bolstered versions. Putting mildly eccentric controls aside, including the nagging driver seat which insists on sliding back when car is shut off, the DRIVE is what this thing is all about. I compared RWD to AWD and opted for RWD. It feels significantly lighter and more responsive. Speaking of responsive, the base 4-cyclinder is hugely responsive, especially when engaging 'Dynamic' mode via control knob. The car feels quick for sure and I dare say, border line FAST.

This new Alfa Romeo Giulia sports sedan is BY FAR, the best car I've ever owned, period.   While it is way too soon to write about reliability issues, which seem to consistently plague Italian made vehicles, I am basing my 44 yrs of car driving experience and knowledge on the car's basics.  Looks, performance, handling, and practicality.  I give this car the highest marks possible in each of those important categories. If you are considering leasing or buying a new 3-Series BMW, C-Class Mercedes, or Audi A4 or Lexus, please drive this car first, so you will be impressed by the overall stupendous drivability and performance of this fantastic Italian masterpiece!

       "  \" The 2017 Giulia Quadrofogilio is a sleeper compared to BMW, Mercedes and even my Porsche 911 4s. I am baffled by some reviews from journalists in that I think that they have never driven the Quadrofogilio. 505 horsepower. 4 different driving modes including race, ceramic brakes and a carbon fiber driveshaft, roof and hood and movable front aero an interior that is far superior to BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Jaguar. My son is 6ft tall and is more comfortable in the back seat than the BMW 3 series or the Jaguar xe or even the Mercedes 300. The infotainment and navigation is better than my Porsche which cost $160k. For a performance vehicle in a sedan who outperforms BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes, and handles as good or better than my 2017 Porsche 9114s for $80 k plus a warranty that is the best in the industry how can you not like the Italian design, handling, comfort and price.  This car looks like a regular family sedan but is built for the track. It is funny how BMW's , Mustangs, and even Corvettes, want to race you and you have the last laugh when you fly past them and they have a look of despair. Up date after 8000 miles no change its like a mad hornet on steroids. This car is amazing way under priced to compare to the competition,it is the fastest 4 door sedan out there today. No mechanical problems unlike the 2017 Porsche which had many electrical problems. Every time we drive the Giulia we all have smiles on our faces. We take long trips in this car and its very comfortable , my son is 6'ft tall and can fit comfortably in the back seat not so in the BMW, Mercedes, or Jaguar.

You can dial the personality you want this car to have...in Dynamic mode (haven\\'t tried \"race\" mode yet, want to break in the car properly!) it feels really tight...in \"natural\" mode, a comfortable daily driver....but you always have the feeling this car wants to run fast.  Unlike some reviews online, i found the interior to be of very high quality...the dashboard looks like it came from a Ferrari.  I am considering a set of Michelin Pilot Sport high performance all season tires, as I can already tell the Pirelli PZero Corsa tires will not last more than about 7,500 miles on the high end!  I have the standard seats, but if you purchase a car with the optional carbon fiber seats, definitely try them before you buy....the basic seats have plenty of bolstering and more power adjustments.  Not that it matters...but so far, in relatively gentle driving (again...trying to break it in for the first 500 miles or so)...average MPG is about 19 according to the on-board computer.  I have the Rosso Competizione exterior color...it looks fabulous...but i did notice that most dealers first Quadrifoglios were Vulcano black.  Although the black looks nice, IMO it doesn\\'t do the car justice, as the carbon fiber bits kind of get \"lost\" in a sea of black....Overall impression...it\\'s even better than I expected!!!!',\n",

The cost was comparable to the SHO--I ended up at around $35k once all the incentives were included (No trade in.)                                                                                                   The fit and finish of this car is amazing.  Tight, quiet, luxurious to the touch.  Get the glass roof.  Without, it seems somewhat looser, more warehouse-y.  The trunk room is pure Alfa Romeo \"What do you need luggage for?\"  And things like cup holders are designed for afternoon tea, not a days\\' worth of coffee in a Yeti.  Bigger containers make adjusting some of the controls a little cumbersome.  No more so that Alfa has done to themselves.  Very frustrating controls for things like the fan motor.  It has a rotary control, but it\\'s brain is attached to the dash display, so rotating the fan one turn only \"wakes the display\" but doesn\\'t do anything for the fan speed.  Not the biggest deal, but you wonder why the two different systems to control one item.  And when you\\'re in reverse, nothing else can be controlled...radio, temp, etc because the reverse view camera is occupying the display.  Like I said, cumbersome.  But that\\'s my only complaint.  My dealer is awesome--they understand a certain level of service is expected here with Alfa--unlike my ford guys.  The is a slight steering wheel rubbing that they are having a time trying to figure out--so until then it\\'s just more volume on the radio (unless I\\'m backing up!)',\n",

Service department always stated that they can replicate my issues and the car was driving as is and designed. They reset my car to manufacture twice and adjusted my cameras grasping for some sort of an explanation.    My car stopped me at a turn light and shuts off.  Then it presence went on in bumper to bumper traffic and my seat belt choked back on me when there was no reason to. My fuel injector malfunctioned at 6000 miles.  Because they can't duplicated the concerns, they dubbed the car safe.  As a driver and my car stops for false pretense detection that could put my life at risk and possible a fatal accident.  It's definite a huge safety concern that I'm having a headache with.  Even with a captured video, what cannot be duplicated becomes the consumers fault. https://youtu.be/txjonKMic1U  Audi service department could not grasp my problem, so I only got service... but I never got the ease of mind for safety, nor the customer satisfaction that my car was fix and safe to drive.  They would hope that they fix it, until my car started shutting off or stopping me.  My car was in the service department more than I could drive it for my sensors and electronic malfunction that puts me at risks.

       "  ' I drive a 2017 Audi A4.  Recently, the programmable radio buttons and MMI began to malfunction.  I brought it in for service expecting a repair under warranty and was told that the problem was “likely” due to liquids spilling onto the buttons, not covered by the warranty.  I would tend to agree with this diagnosis BECAUSE the radio buttons are positioned directly next to the cup holders.  It is almost impossible to avoid spilling liquid into the buttons because of this design.  Even the motion of the car with a cup of liquid in the holder could easily cause liquid to spill into the radio buttons.  Nevertheless, this is clearly a design flaw with the center console.  I have been a computer engineer since 1983 therefore my ability to recognize a user interface design issue is my business.  But it doesn’t take an engineer to recognize the poor design of the center console.  I contacted Audi customer support AudiCustomerExperienceCenter@audi.com and after waiting almost two months, the customer service rep never bothered to provide a final response.  Instead, I had to escalate, searching the internet for another way to contact Audi, who agreed to cover only the parts ($600) but not the labor costs ($300).  I did not accept this offer because the design of the center console is the cause of this issue because it’s inevitable that liquid will spill into the radio buttons given that they are positioned right next to the cup holder.  So there you have it.  Audi has decided to lose a customer for $300 over what in my opinion and experience is a design flaw.  This is my second A4.  The cup holder of the 2012 A4 was NOT positioned next to the radio buttons.  In 2017 Audi changed the console and created this problem.',\n",

The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn't help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector.

Removed housing from another vehicle and found it did the same thing. Contacted product support. Was advised this condition is \"normal\" and vehicle needs to be in recirculation mode or A/C OFF while going through a car wash!\"So according to Audi those of us living in the south should turn off our A/C or put it in recirculation mode to go through a car wash?

I\\'m not talking about the engine turning off to save fuel, I\\'m talking about completely off to the point we have to hit start again for the car to reboot.

The car would not move without shacking. The car was towed to the for them to fix. The dealership was helpful and apologized of course. Never the less I find this completey unacceptable given the fact the we have to go threw this with a brand new car. Love the look of both inside and out but so far has not been reliable.\",\n",

And of course, around midday, the sun will surely hit it because the Audi design is so aerodynamic.  This Aluminum thing reminds me of a similar design that Honda came up with about 12 years ago for its Civic.  That was glaring too.  But Honda dropped it.   But Audi caught it and put it on its A4??  So I recommend paying extra for the dark wood or brown wood.  About everything else, A4 is completely redesigned.  I'm quite happy.  I may write an update in 6 months.\",\n",

In the first week of owning it, the car developed a major engine problem that originated on the manufacturer's assembly line. The repair was major, and I was advised by independent engineers that there is no assurance that this car could not have another major problem in the future. The dealer was sympathetic and offered me an Audi Care package and 12,000 new car warranty miles.

The dealer had a loaded AWD that we drove. I was impressed with the way it handled and drove. Living in Florida, I figured a front wheel drive would be enough for us, so we ordered a FWD Premium Plus. After delivery and driving it several times, I felt like it was not like the car we drove at the dealer. It was sluggish and hesitated at stop lights and the shift points seemed off.  I made an appointment at around 2500 miles to have it checked out. No problems were found; the Audi tech said he wanted to explain something that we may not have known when we ordered the SUV. He said the AWD and FWD have different transmissions and the AWD is more spirited and reacts when stepping on the gas, whereas the FWD is more economy minded. A light went off in my head  that answered my nagging question. Now, I have a one year old Audi Q3 that I don't find fun to drive anymore. I'm waiting for the 2019 Q3 and Q4 models to come out, but in the mean time, Consumer Reports Magazine just put the new 2018 BMW X3 at the top of the list for compact SUV's.

Ultimately poor ergo dynamics led us to sell the car at 8 months of ownership and 9500 miles.  Getting in and out of the car was difficult without hitting your head or shoulders.  Getting out of the car the back of legs would always hit the door sill trim which sticks out too much.  The gear shifter is different then standard automatics - easy enough to figure out but difficult if going from a different vehicle to this one.  Cupholders are in the worst possible location - under buttons.  Every time a cup is removed or placed in the holder a finger gets scraped.  The MMI (technology) buttons and knob are between the shifter and the cupholders.  One spill on the MMI controls and they are likely to get ruined and replacement costs are not covered by warranty (even the dealer warned us).  The radio volume control knob seems to be in a great place on the console but way too easy to hit with a bag - change the volume, turn off the volume.  The radio display - when a station is changed the display changes to the new station and then mysteriously shows the previous station (does not change the music) for about 10-15 seconds - why would it do that???  Strange click-click from under the car on the first acceleration with each time the car is turned on.

Interpret that as you may, I am rather conservative on the road. A simple search will help the consumer understand that this is not unique experience and that there are numerous complaints out there. Audi has no solution in sight.  Had I known about this issue I most certainly would have made another car buying decision.

While the engine has the punch in 'dynamic' mode, it lacks in 'auto' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn't great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls.

This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet; curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I've been more critical than happy so far...

Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.

Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I'm happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.  Run flats are a huge disadvantage all around.  I haven't got into the maintenance phase yet, but I'll update my post at that time.\",\n",

The RAV4 has a bunch of compartments for all my stuff. The A4 has nothing other than the glove box. No sunglasses holder.

The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly \"Mickey Mouse ears\" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21\" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs.',\n",

Audi chose to save weight and space (like many other companies) by eliminating the spare tire.   They commissioned a tire just for just this vehicle resulting in an extreme cost of $528.00 per tire!  The last item is the jack.  The Audi engineers could not find space for the jack anywhere in the vehicle, so it is unsecured in the rear cargo area making it a missile in the event of an accident.

I also stuck with the stock 18\" 245/45 all weather tires because of their higher profile. On the plus side are its stylish look in Florett Silver with Atlas Beige/Dark Walnut interior, great handling, extreme comfort, great temperature and direction controls, wonderful visibility, well-designed driver assistance, and great parking assist (easiest car I have ever parked beside the 2017 Q5). The virtual cockpit and heads up displays are easy to use, informative and very helpful. It\\'s great having the Nav display directly in front of the driver. The transmission shifts smoothly, and for such a powerful car, it is surprisingly quiet  when accelerating, and there is virtually no wind noise when cruising, The ECO start/stop was a little hard to get used to (abrupt stop), but I really like the fuel savings it affords around town. Speaking of fuel economy, I have been getting between 30-36 mpg on trips and averaging 25 mpg combined. FANTASTIC! I think the secret is that I allow the adaptive cruise to pretty much control the car on a trip. On the \"con\" side, the info system does take time to figure out. I spent over 2 hours with Audi Connect getting the AT&T SD card and navigation system reprogrammed, I am still learning the system. I wish all the information on the retractable Nav screen could be turned off so the entire screen displayed the route. I wish connection to the internet was included in the price like GM proposes to do on its new models. The garage door HomeLink was a bear to set. The salesman spent over an hour at my home setting it up, but it has worked well since being programmed. Dash glare is another \"con.\" I had ordered the brown interior and dash trim with the expectation that dash glare would be reduced. NOT! My 2011 Volvo S80 had a similar colored dash that gave off almost no dash glare. Instead of using a grained glare-reducing material over the entire dash, Audi used hard plastic around the heads up display and other selected places which, in combination, produces a lot of reflection on the windshield. It apparently failed to engineer the windshield angle to reduce glare on the type of dash materials it chose to use. I also join others in expressing a desire that the car have a little more storage space in the front passenger compartment, but I have learned to do more with less junk in the cabin of the car. It is only these later \"cons\" that kept me from giving the car 5 stars overall. Its looks, its performance, its comfort, fuel economy, etc. all call for 5 stars. Because of some convenience issues, however, I could only give it 4 overall. (PS: The price for this category of car was in line with its competitors, and I thought the dealer treated me fairly considering the additional warranties that were included in the out-the-door price. Therefore, the price rating should be read as an N/A. It was not a factor in my ratings.)',\n",

Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We\\'ve since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+; some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off); the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won\\'t hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the \"new\" rep - all the while I was calling their office and even asking Audi US office to help - I had to drive up to the dealership again. This time I asked for the sale manager and told him that I wanted an answer from him directly. This guy, their sale manager, PROMISED to my face, that he would definitely get back to me within a week, \"before next Friday\"... Well, Fridays have come and gone and it\\'s been more than a month yet not a single word from anyone at that dealership. Granted, those issues (e.g. missing key code) are mostly annoyance, not exactly life threatening. But you expect  certain service when you buy a $60,000+ car and want to have some trust in the dealership that they will take care of certain problems when needed. It\\'s a shame because honestly we like the car, but the poor customer service has put a huge dent in our enthusiasm and adds a significant doubt as to how long we should hold on to this car.Update 8-2017: The experience with the service department at this dealership has been better than the sales side - yes I have been using their service despite the really bad experience with their sales because of the location and convenience. They are still not as responsive as I would expect when it comes to schedule appointments etc but they do get the job done on time once I get the car in and the folks at the service department are courteous and some of them even go out of their way to help.',\n",

You have the ability to control all the cameras; that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360-degree views at will.  The driver's seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals; and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift; and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It's a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car's technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package. It has been a year,  and I do like this car.  I have figured out most of the tech and am just disappointed in the recurring monthly charge to keep maps and all up to date.  That runs twenty bucks a month. Given the sudden changes in weather we have been experiencing, I am pleased I am in a mobile mini-fortress. Even with all the safety features it is still worthwhile to remember no one can drive on ice.I have had the Q-7 for a while now and still enjoy its major benefits as drivability, acceleration, comfort, and safety. But front storage is still a problem that can't be fixed. The official Audi app is close to useless, and Audi should pull it from the market period. Overall the Q-7 is a superb driving machine.\",\n",
       "  \" We enjoyed the test drive and were thinking serious about this SUV. Good looking and good finishes made this attractive in comparison to the X5 and GLE 350. Drove great.  We found the technology a little cumbersome but that could be expected as it was new to us but not as difficult as other test drives. The navigation voice commands could not recognize very much. The salesman indicated that it would get used to our voices. Right.  I checked this out with a current owner. He confirmed that voice commands are limited to his contact list.  The kicker for me was there was no spare tire! The salesman went looking for it and could not find it! It was sorta funny but it wasn't.  Their defense was it was equipped was run-flat tires with a 50 mile range. That may work for city slickers but we go to remote locations and that won't hunt. The  X5 also has no spare.  I understand that this is becoming more common but its not for me.\",\n",

       "  \" I previewed many of the luxury sedans in this segment: Mercedes C300 4Matic, Lexus IS AWD, BMW 330i X-Drive and Acura TLC A-Spec w/Super Handling AWD. The value proposition on the Audi surpassed the others. Living in the N.E. AWD is a must, so the Quattro option Premium Plus was the best deal for me. The fit and finish is excellent. Yes, the exterior may be a bit conservative compared to the others in the segment - but it's classy without being gaudy. The interior is a technical marvel. The Virtual Cockpit has to be seen to be believed, none of the competitors can match Audi's current tech and Google Earth maps. Apple Car Play works seamlessly and the MMI system is fairly intuitive. With the exception of the Acura, the rival cars get pricey when you add the tech and safety features already in the Premium Plus version of the Audi A4. The ride and handling is very good, granted the BMW still shines in this area - but their tech is somewhat dated. In addition, the A4 cabin is very quiet and inviting. The 19 speaker Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system is remarkable, it sounds like your virtually in a live concert. The Acura A-Spec is the probably the best value proposition and has more horses but lacks the refinement of the Audi and Acura's duel screen infotainment system seems dated even though refreshed in 2017. On balance, the A4 is almost perfect in it's execution of daily tasks called upon by a sedan and is a pleasure to drive.\",\n",
       "  \" First of all, I have owned a lot of cars. But, I think I found the one. I bought this car four months ago. I have the premium plus. So here is what I like: I love the feel of a luxury car. When I close the door, I feel closed off from the outside and it is VERY quiet, I like that. I love the leather, the style and the look of the car. The instrument panel is really nice. It's easy to understand and easy to operate. What I was really surprised about is the power and the handling of the car. It has more power than I am use too. That is not something I really look for in a car, but this one has it and I find that I really like it.\",\n",

There is nothing like a Quattro Audi, I drive one myself as well and even if you don't get snow it's really nice the way it handles the road. The main thing about the Q3? It listens to the driver. Go try the x3 or the x1 or the lexus rx: they're great cars but they have a mind of their own. The other thing is that we got an amazing deal thanks to Edmunds forums. I found out the residuals and the money rate, I followed advice on how to shop and I got a really great deal. It's a premium plus with the sport plus trim, which makes it look even nicer than stock.

       "  ' I’ve been a long-time Audi owner (A6, TT, A4) so it seemed pretty straight-forward to try out the Audi line when we were ready to replace our SUV. I had been eagerly awaiting the US release of the Q3 after researching it from afar. Before buying, I drove the Q7 and Q5 for comparison. Both beautiful cars, but we were looking for something compact. I give the Q3 5-stars in every category but acceleration, control logic, and road noise. The acceleration is fine, just a little less gutsy than some of the Audis I’ve fricen before. The control logic is great, except for the sound system control. They’ve moved it from the main center console to the center dash console. (Edit: after driving the vehicle for 8 months I no longer notice the difference) Road noise in an SUV is almost always going to be heard, add in winter tires on weathered roads and it’s pretty much impossible to keep it quiet. Not too bad, considering. Everything else has been exactly what I have come to expect from an Audi.',\n",

More space than you possibly imagine, huge cargo, very comfortable second row (don't look, sit on and you know what I am talking about). Length is the same with SUVs like Lexus RX 350, only with lower ride height, giving substantially better driving pleasure. Technology wise I don't know a car better than this except tesla, definitely better than current BMW (2017). Combination of advanced lane assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist almost make this car driveless, removing most of driving pressure, but still in practical level (you have the control instead of the car itself). Luxury interior, fantastic lighting and high quality inlay and leather.

It\\'s not as flashy as either one of its competitors, but that\\'s something I like.  It\\'s understated elegance is perfect for me and anyone else who wants to drive an amazing car that doesn\\'t say \"I\\'m trying to keep up with the Joneses\".  Car enthusiast know what you\\'re driving but the average person just thinks you got a clean, elegant looking and nice sounding sedan.  Some of my favorite features are the massaging seats (many variations of messaging available), 14 speaker - 630 watt Bose sound system, infotainment system (once you figure it out), options on ambient lighting, Google maps (the best!), Apple Car Play, USB connections (finally), clean exterior lines, gorgeous interior styling, acceleration (off the charts), and finally driving and handling ability!

       "  ' Looked at the 2016 BMW 5 series and the latest Mercedes E class (4 cylinder model). Ruled out the new 5 series for fear of 1st model year run reliability woes and the 6 cylinder E class is just too expensive.   Just loved the ride and handling of the A6, it\\'s the right combination of sport and luxury. Plus this is the only German midsize you can order with REAR side airbags  and of course outstanding crash testing. The ride and handling are outstanding. Some formal car magazine reviews had stated the steering is  numb or light but I do not have that impression. The V6  gives you power whenever you want. I purchased a factory order Premium Plus with 19\" sport package and the layered walnut. The 19\" wheels ride well without added harshness and the 10 spoke wheels look stunning when paired with Florett Silver body color. The  black headliner with black leather and layered walnut wood option make the cabin exceptionally rich.  The MMI interface doesn\\'t take that long to figure out. Voice commands are a little slow but the map with google earth view is pretty cool. The instrument cluster driver display can be customized to show different driver info and is nearly the equal of the newer cars that have the all digital display for the driver instrument panel. The Bose stereo is  good but not great (and wasn\\'t going to cough up $4200 for the Bang and Olufsen upgrade). Driver\\'s assistance package work very well especially the adaptive cruise control keeping distance from the car ahead of you and lane assist keeping you in the lane.

The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20\" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people.

       "  ' Update: Everything on the initial review still applies 5,000 miles later.Original review: This is a very high quality vehicle.  Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350; making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don\\'t mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20\" tires (Goodyear) that our Prestige has so you have to wonder how many tire shops within a 50 mile radius would have a replacement tire in the event of a tire failure.  I read horror stories about ROF tires, but ride quality, noise, and handling are not an issue in the Q7.  Due to all the technology there will be a very steep learning curve.',\n",
       "  ' Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn\\'t in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21\") on shows two manufacturers (Goodyear & Continental) with a price per tire near $500.  The interior is very nice.  The one drawback is the lack of storage bins.  There are only two small bins.  The one under the arm rest will hold a pair of sunglasses but leaves only a little room for anything else.  The CD player is located in the glove box so if you want to play a CD you have to load it before you start driving.  The virtual cockpit allows you to do many things without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  Functions like the radio and phone can be selected and controlled on the steering wheel so you don\\'t have to look to the side to make a call or change the radio station.  The blind spot warning lights are on the side mirrors cover and are easier to see than just a small emblem on the mirror.  The speed limit for most streets is displayed on the instrument panel and the heads up display.  You can set a reminder that will cause the posted speed limit to flash if you exceed it more than the amount you set.  A very nice reminder in residential areas.  It also lets you know if you are in a school zone although it will still flash as if you are speeding even when school is not in session.  My wife has a very hard time pulling straight into a parking spot.  The parking assist will display your position in the parking spot so if you are at an angle or taking up two spots you can see it before you exit the car.  This is a great car (a little pricey) if you know the small shortcomings.After 5000 miles I still enjoy driving the Q7.  I love the heads up display.  I won\\'t buy another care without it.  It took a little while to learn to use the adaptive cruise control and I don\\'t drive on the freeway anymore without using it.  It does have a few quirks though.  The set speed automatically adjusts downward with a decreased speed limit which is good but it sometimes reduces speed even though there is no change in the speed limit.  This is especially true if the road had a long term construction project.  The cameras will also occasionally miss an increase in the posted speed so the speed sign will flash until you pass another speed sign and this can be for many miles.  The camera doesn\\'t recognize all the signs indicating the end of a school zone so it will also flash until you finally come across another speed limit sign.  There are a  couple of irritants.  The drivers door has developed a rattle when driving over a slightly rough road and the dealership hasn\\'t been able to fix.   (I didn\\'t have this rattle after 100k miles on my Lexus SUV.)  Also the steering wheel is slightly \"off\" level.  That is if I put the steering wheel \"level\" the car will move to the right and it this includes driving in a parking lot.  The dealer checked the alignment and said it is ok but it still does it.  The backup sensor is nice but when I have a bike rack in the trailer hitch the warning tone is constant when backing up so you don\\'t get a sense about how close you are to objects behind you based on the tone.  The car computes the estimated miles remaining before the next fill up but it tends to over estimate the gas mileage so it can be up to 100 miles  less than indicated on the display.  It is more noticeable when driving long distances on an interstate highway.After 14000 miles I like the car.  I had to have the motor that controls the driver side mirror replaced.  This required resetting the cameras that are used in to indicate car position ( lane & parking) and it took all day.  They also looked at the door rattle.  They could hear it bout couldn’t find the source.  A manufacturer rep said it was the seals so they applied something to the seals.  The door still rattles.  The MMI connect which give you info about the car is now incorrectly telling me a window is open.  I had to make an appointment to get it fixed.  I just drove on a 4K mile trip.  It doesn’t get near the advertised mpg.  There is a screen that gives you the mpg for the trip nut it is off 3 to 4 mpg.  (Checked at every fill up.). The engine seems to burn small amount of oil.  Trailer hitch can’t be locked.',\n",
       "  ' I have been considering this car, but I wanted to have a real testing experience before actually shelling out $60,000+.  So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions; as usual, the \"secret\" is to accelerate gradually.                        DRIVING EXPERIENCE: It is boring (Lexus RX 350 sort of feeling) in Auto mode. More exciting (BMW X5 sort of thing) in Dynamic mode. I was actually surprised by how agile and stable the car is going uphill at good speeds in Dynamic mode. A true Dr. Jeckyll  and Mr. Hide sort of personality.   The car is long, but parallel parking is actually easier than I was expecting. Mind you, I said easier and not easy. Without the rearview camera and at night in dark areas, it is not completely a \"piece of cake\". Driving uphill on serious pitches like in Old-Town San Diego was more pleasant that I hoped for. I was a tad concerned on some pitches when I had to come to a complete stop, but the car proved excellent.                                                                          NOISE: Wind noise in more than on the BMW X5, at least once I hit 80mph-ish.. Road noise is definitely low. Excellent in that sense.                                      INTERIORS It is well detailed, it not exceptionally luxurious, at least not in the Premium or Premium plus trims. Unfortunately, the Luxury package (another $6k) is available only in the Prestige trim.   The car is comfortable, but not exceptionally comfortable. I am 6\\'2\" and 245lbs, and on a 4 hour + driving I wished the car had a better support for my thighs . The seats feel comfortable, but after hours of driving, did not feel that comfy anymore.  The double shade panels in front are an excellent touch. I wonder why more cars do not have them since that is an inexpensive feature..                          INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions.  For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though).  The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking.  But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.   BRAKING.  It is overall fine, but in two instances I found myself wishing it could be a little more prompt. But that could just be me and the fact that I am used to a different car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            LIGHTS: The Q7 lighting system ranks among the good ones. Drove it at night on hilly and narrow roads with nothing in terms of street lights and I always felt that I had a good view of the road, in particular using the high beam lights.                                                                                                                        OVERALL GRADE (A-): It has about all a driver would want, but it is fun to drive only in Dynamic mode.  The visual luxury is all there, but it is not 100% comfortable.',\n",
       "  ' I was looking a car for couple months. I compared SUVs from Volvo, Benz, BMW, Porsche and Lexus. Audi Q7 is the best one.',\n",
       "  ' Car is super easy to drive. Super quiet too. Any size concerns related to parking go away with the visual package and the 360 view. As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.10k update: Car keeps driving great and fuel economy got to 21.5 miles/gal. Two minor issues: climate control cannot be synch-ed from the driver controls, you have to manually do it. You have to look at the temperature in the second row as well. Not ideal for a car of this price. One of the speakers will have to be changed as it has a raspy sound in some specific range. It will be covered under the warranty. All things considered, still very happy. Pleasure to drive.20k update. Very pleased with the car. All works as expected. Pleasure to drive. I bounce between the auto and comfort drive mode. Fuel economy a little above 22 mpg now. I extended the satellite radio service. I have not extended the Audi google map and news service, I think that it is too expensive and they should offer a more competitive price or maybe separate the google map connectivity from the rest of the features. Without the google map service your navigation system works but it is not smart. It will not update route based on traffic. If you want that you will need to use the Apple service through car play.',\n",
       "  \" Absolutely love the car. I've only had it since October 9th, but it has a great feeling of quality and solidity. The interior is well made and of high quality components. Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW's comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It's quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn't. Also, because Audi doesn't make enough of the Q7's, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit. (Pretty much plan on no incentives and no discount on price) Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, and would do it again.Starting just over 10,000 Miles, the brakes started making a horrible squeaking and squealing noise coming to a stop and backing up. VERY LOUD. Audi dealer says Audi NA is aware and working on a fix.... I’m still driving around with it noisy and unacceptable.\",\n",
       "  ' If you are interested in this vehicle you likely have read the many terrific reviews from Motorweek, Car and Driver, and even Consumer Reports. I certainly did. I was able to get the vehicle at a small discount which was lucky as some dealers are now asking above sticker or loading on even more packs. The car is a joy to drive and while some have compared the \"Virtual Cockpit\" to a video game, I find it helpful and very effective at communicating information, which is what a dash should do. The placement of controls is excellent, and they are well organized by function. The volume control for all uses (voice, phone, audio) is delightfully located on the console where one\\'s hand naturally falls. The shifter takes a while to get used to, but Audi seems to have anticipated a learning curve. When I first owned it I tried to put it in reverse without stepping on the brake pedal. The dash lit up to inform me I needed to do so. There are a few issues. First, interior storage for the driver is simply unavailable. The console holds virtually nothing and there is not even a sunglass holder. The absences of cubbies is a disappointment, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have had two minor problems. First, one day the alarm system went off every time I tried to lock the vehicle. The dealer (only a mile away, happily) was able to remedy this in less than an hour. Second, the steering wheel is no longer centered after only 2,500 miles. That, too, will be corrected by the dealer. Overall, it\\'s a terrific vehicle as far as I am concerned, despite minor issues.Update, April 2017: Car sat for much of the winter as I had to have emergency back surgery. As soon as I was able, I was driving again, and my very positive impression of the driver\\'s seat was reconfirmed the moment I sat in it again. Very supportive, but not confining. Was able to drive 6 hours (with breaks) and no discomfort. Got stuck in stop-and-go traffic entering Chicago (no surprise) and the Traffic Jam Assist feature, previously untested, worked perfectly. Very impressive. With cruise control set at 73 I got a steady 26+ MPG. Around town am averaging about 22.5. Overall, VERY pleased with vehicle.Update, October 2017: Still very happy with this vehicle. The longer I own it, the more impressed I am with the subtle benefits of Audi\\'s technology. The touch pad works very well, and the audio is amazing. I still remain slightly irritated by the absence of small-item storage for the driver. After 15 months, the build quality is evident. I am delighted overall.Update: April, 2018: Remain very pleased with the vehicle, but as in any long-term relationship some of the bloom does go off the rose. One annoying problem has arisen--noisy brakes when in reverse under most weather condition. Horrendous squeal. Dealer says Audi is \"working on a fix\" but that they were having similar problems with the Q5 (not sure if he meant the new model or the pre-2018). The \"fix\" for the Q5 has not worked well and dealer has no idea when Audi will be able to correct this annoyance. And a few more minor gripes: Why does Audi choose when the headlight washers come on? In previous vehicles, I could do this manually. With Audi, certain parameters must be met before the system operates automatically, or so I am lead to believe. I am not sure they have ever come on. I still wish that Audi had come up with some storage solutions for the driver\\'s cockpit and elsewhere (no storage for the jack??) So, yes, I am increasingly aware that this is an imperfect vehicle in minor ways, but would not hesitate to buy it again. It\\'s still a terrific drive!',\n",

       "  ' My wife and I drove every minivan and 3 row crossover.  Rather than going into the pros and cons of every one, I will just say we chose the Q7 because of its tremendous balance between ride and handling, its superior quietness and solid feeling, and combined comfort of the first and second rows.  We also suspect that the Audi will be more reliable than the Volvo XC90 (although the Volvo is somewhat less expensive, has superior interior design and has a more comfortable first and third row).   While the Q7 cost more money than we needed to spend, I believe it is worth every dollar.  So do many others.  In my area, every Q7 was spoken for.  I purchased mine from a dealer 200 miles away,',\n",

       "  ' I replaced a 2011 Q7 S-Line with 100,000 miles with the new 2017.  I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user interface to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang & Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG at average driving speeds of around 75MPH.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range is just as good on the 2017 despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  The keyless entry is still bizarre and its built in \"safety features\" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  The ability to utilize the map on the driver\\'s dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry is still bizarre, the logic behind the \"personal safety feature \" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  I am frequently cussing out some unknown Audi programming or product management team somewhere unknown....  My advice to the Audi programming team is to go try a Lexus keyless entry system, it always works and lets you in the car.  Also, I have given up on the  hands free tailgate opening.  I end up dancing in the parking lot and ultimately just pull out the remote.Seating comfort with the luxury package is excellent and highly configurable.Probably the biggest improvement is in the longevity of the tires and brakes.  I currently have 53,000 miles on the vehicle and I still have 6-7 mm of tread remaining on the original factory Eagle Sport runflats and minimal wear on the original brake pads.  I am very happy with the OEM tires in all weather conditions and they have been great in the Wisconsin weather.So far my only three complaints or observations are:1,) Aforementioned keyless entry and hands free tailgate programming issues. 2.) The tilt steering does not go down close enough to my legs for my own personal taste, seems to stop in too high (straight) of a setting.3.) On an overcast or partially sunny day it seems like the auto fan setting wants to stay in too high of a setting and basically makes you feel cold and also creates more noise than necessary.Overall the vehicle is excellent and I enjoy my daily drive.',\n",
       "  \" We spent month looking at, researching, and reading about the 2017 Q7.   This car has exceeded our expectations in all categories.  Beautiful to look at, easy to drive, and comfortable for all passengers.  The Q7 is roomy enough for trips to the big box store, while feeling like a comfy sports car.  My Porsche driving husband is impressed by the handling at highway speeds and in parking lots.  The rear seats provided more than ample leg room for two 6'+ passengers.  I love all the creature comforts and goodies: get the Premium Plus!\",\n",
       "  \" The safety driving features are the best part of the Audi except the shear joy of driving it!  I have over 41,000 miles on my car in less that a year and a half and you need all of the protection you can get on the road these days!  Smooth, comfortable, great maneuverability!    You might be making a BIG mistake if you don't try this one out yourself!\",\n",
       "  \" I spent a ton of time researching and comparing the Q7 with the 2016 BMW X5 and the Volvo XC90. I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car & Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner's manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn't up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can't even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile. I love this SUV!\",\n",
       "  \" We have had the car for a couple weeks - Orca Black/Black Interior/Prestige Trim. I spent quite some time with the X5, Volvo XC90, MB GLE, Acura MDX, etc. and this car hands down performed better in my opinion. The interior is stunning though the exterior is a bit tame. Although it is still very early, we haven't had any problems and the service at our Audi dealership has been fantastic. This car is a replacement to a Q5 TDI we have had for a few years, also zero issues.\",\n",
       "  ' I recently purchased new 2017 Audi Q7 Prestige.  I went with the prestige package since it includes cold weather, warm weather, 20\" wheels, and the vision packages for a better overall value.  As a previous owner of a 2013 Audi Q7 I was immediately impressed with the way the 2017 model feels in regards to handling, steering feel, and performance.  The 2017 model has shaved off 500+ lbs from the previous platform and makes the Q7 feel more like a car.  The 3 Liter engine has plenty of power (333hp), smooth shifts from the 8-spd transmission, and great road grip with little body roll.  I would describe the 2017 Q7 as nimble,  something I could never say about the previous Q7 model - which felt more like a tank.  I look forward to driving the Q7 everyday, and right now im looking for excuses to go take it out just so I can drive it.  Audi took a long time to re-design the Q7, but I think they got everything right: style, performance, comfort, and technology.',\n",
       "  \" My wife and I have owned primarily BMW products for the last 25 years until my wife leased a VW Tiguan three years ago.  I drove it from time to time and was impressed so when it was time to replace a 2012 X5 I looked at the redesigned Q7.  The ride, handling, and performance is as good or better than the X5 and the fit and finish is far superior.  It has a little more room inside while not seeming to be larger on the outside.  The ride is a little less harsh and more quiet than the X5.  Handling install responsive and the turning radius is excellent.  It is a joy to drive.  It is also easier to fit multiple sets of golf clubs horizontally in the cargo area.  I have had the car for about a month and so far no problems.  Everything works well.  The 2017 redesign is a great improvement over the previous model.  Can't say enough good things about this vehicle.\",\n",
       "  \" This car is very quick and luxurious and for the price is a bargain (if that can be said for a car costing $90k plus.).  I average over 19 mpg around town and over25 on the highway.  It is not the sexyist looking but it is not a big feeling as the MB S class.  Like all luxury sedans it suffers great depreciation in the first two years as the market has moved towards SUV's.  So lease and don't buy as otherwise you are throwing money away.\",\n",
       "  ' My A8 L is a 2017 3.0T Quattro Tiptronic with everything including the adaptive chassis and front power seats with massage. In other words, you really can\\'t beat this car for comfort. Even the controls are laid out in a configuration that makes sense, and with easy access so your fingers don\\'t fumble around when you want to reach out for something. The highest compliment I can give this car is that I actual enjoy being a passenger when my wife is driving. Not that my wife is a bad driver, but usually I am a horrible passenger. The ride is amazingly smooth and acceleration is close to driving a sports car. The safety features are amazing and should you be using lane assist, you will get an audible warning to tell you to put your hands back on the wheel. Some people aren\\'t fans of all the safety features but I am. Given the condition of roads and the amount of distracted drivers out there, I like feeling I might have an edge. The navigation system is excellent and it also provides you with traffic conditions and problems ahead. I did purchase extended warranties guaranteeing me bumper to bumper protection through 2023, including scratch protection. These automobiles are really comfortable computers on wheels and only a fool would fail to protect themselves in case a computer board or chip gets fried. My collision insurance took a slight jump as these wouldn\\'t be inexpensive cars to repair, but it wasn\\'t a bump such that it is highly noticeable; more like a hundred dollar jump. My wife has pretty much appropriated this car. She prefers the shift over the newer electronic shifter where you press \"P\" for park rather than actually move the shift into park. No doubt the 2018 model has upgraded but my wife is putting off the inevitable as long as she can.  Now, my wife isn\\'t a lead foot by any means, but she likes a car to jump when she hits the accelerator. She also appreciates the ease by which she can manuver.  We may keep this car for a couple of years.',\n",

The summer tires are sticky and you can feel the car hugging the road on high speed turns.  Every stop light becomes a starting line and I cannot resist passing every Prius I see.  Handles beautifully in any kind of weather, in traffic and the on the open road.  The B&O speakers transform my commute into a concert (although my hearing is suffering! LOL).   Unfortunately, shortly after I leased this car, I got a new job 70 miles from my home.  My only regret is the mileage that I am putting on this beautiful car, however, now that I have experienced driving it, I could never settle for anything less.',\n",

Thus, if you are a commuter the ultra is OUTSTANDING. A great experience, only that the car is slower in acceleration for 2 seconds. NO ONE (without tickets) speed up like that. Thus, I am extremely happy.',\n",
       "  \" After 10 plus years driving BMW, I decided to look at some other options mainly because I wanted to try something different. After being an avid Audi hater for years I reluctantly went to look at the A4 because a family friend worked there and I could potentially get a great deal. Let me tell you, WOW! I was sold instantly after only sitting in the car. Audi has stepped up their game on the vehicles interior and in my opinion has completely SHAT on BMW's interior look. Fast forward to driving this car.. again WOW! In my 328 i felt every pot hole etc as I drove. Driving the A4 is the smoothest, quietest experience I have ever had in a car. The only complaint I have and its a small one is that the gas pedal is slightly slow to react but its barely noticeable. Overall, the Audi A4 is has far surpassed my expectations. If you make the switch from BMW, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       "  \" I traded in my 2007 BMW 335i, which I owned for 7 years and had a blast driving.  However, it was a money pit since it was out of warranty and breaking down more and more frequently.  I went car shopping and looked at the new BMW 330s, Infiniti Q50s, and Lexus IS 300s.  Then I test drove the Audi A4 and the search was over.  It had everything I was looking for: AWD, fun to drive with plenty of power, good gas mileage, great looks, and the best technology in its class.  Others may have more have more power on paper, but this car feels just as fast if not faster.  Excellent value for the money...highly recommend a test drive if you're car searching.\",\n",

       "  \" Have driven BMWs, Jaguars, and Acuras before, and this 2017 Audi A4 with the virtual cockpit is one nice car.  While the ride is firm, the driving feels light and with purpose.  The acceleration is exhilarating and fast.  The braking is trusted and precise.  Maneuvering this car is so effortless, it makes race car drivers out of everyone.  The overall external look is understated yet well designed with luxury and sportiness in mind.  The internal is simple and nicely laid out but with technology oozing and quality materials and standard leather seats cradling you every time you drive.  The MMI is simply the best and easiest to use.   I'm running out of superlatives to use, but don't just read this review, go and actually drive one, and all the others like BMWs and the Benzes, and you will more than likely come to the same conclusion.UPDATE:  After over a year of driving the A4, it still drives so fine and fast.  Had my yearly maintenance.  No issues found.  The A4 is such an amazing machine that you don't have to think about or even worry that something will conk out.  Acceleration is still fluid and fast.  Transmission shifts crisply.  Car electronics works as advertised.  Yay to the A4.  A solid and refined sporty car.  Update: it’s been 9 months and I’m still loving my A4. It’s like coming home when I get into it. All the controls are in the right place. It’s still zippy fast and the gas mileage compared to my previous Acura MDX has been a godsend. It’s very easy to love the A4. It just works and it does it very well.\",\n",
       "  \" I have owned 2 x 2017 Audi A4 in the span of 6 months. I traded in a 2013 BMW 320i with Stage 1 Dinan 6 speed manual (comparable to stock 328 i) for 2017 Audi A4 Premium Quattro. When I did the test drive, I drove the one with sport package and Premium Plus trim. I chose this car over Lexus IS 350/IS200t/IS300 , Jaguar XE, BMW 328i and BMW 340i(yeah!) first time around. the key reason was the responsiveness of 7 speed Dual Clutch transmission(coming from manual). Although other brands have numbers behind them, the transmission-engine combination can challenge the higher engine trim Jaguars and BMWs and it is way more refined. The Quattro system is obvious while cornering or taking turns with confidence, especially when it is wet. Dallas toll roads can be very prone to hydroplaning and boy, does it rain hard here.   First time around.. to save costs, I went with the Premium.  The car drove well(super quick with launch control and sport mode, paddles), but I was not happy with the speakers and sound system, although I am far from being an audiophile and I was not a fan of the base system and I was not a fan of the Ibis white exterior without the S-Line trim. So decided to bite the bullet and trade it in with 6200 miles and 6 months of ownership for 2017 A4 with Premium Plus/-Quattro with Sport Package. Although sport suspension and seats don't seem to make a difference on paper, they make a big difference in the way this car handles. I don't have the adaptive damper package which is available in Prestige trim, but this suspension is how this car should be in the first place. It is way more planted without being jarring and a ride quality/comfort above anything else in its genre. But coming from BMW, this is more close to the handling I am used to. I am a happy camper now. I love the Android Auto/Apple CarPlay with the Bang and Olufsen 3D sound. I personally stayed away from Tech Package(although cool and envy inducing and great conversation piece) since in my opinion, it is a little too risky to have in a first year German vehicle...So bottom line is for those normal people(not the trackers and oversteer/opposite lock enthusiats) migrating from BMW and convinced about 2017 A4(which should  not be difficult  ), I would highly recommend checking the Sport Package and Quattro. For someone with slightly elevated sense of sportiness in a car, it is a perfect fit for me. Also, I have lost money on Premium to warrant such an opinion, I guess..:-)\",\n",
       "  \" This car does have that balance of comfort and sporty drive. BMW may be sportier, while Lexus may be more comfort, for me this is the best of both worlds.   I've only had two weeks but love the ride, acceleration, and he included features. Comfortable seats. Nice cockpit. Overall exterior design is great.   Only negative as some have mentioned is that there appears to be some kind of lag when first hitting the accelerator which I'm still getting used to. But once it gets going, even the 190hp engine is pretty decent.\",\n",
       "  \" I'm loving the car so far.  Imho it's the best value in the small luxury sport sedan class this year.   I have the premium plus trim and it has almost everything you would want.  But if you want all possible safety features you will need to step up to the prestige trim. Also the interior LED lights that allow you to change color is only on the prestige, the premium plus has only the white interior LED lights.  Some web sites say the car is slow off the line... I haven't noticed.  It feels amazingly smooth and easily goes 0-60 in 5 secs.   Also some sites have dinged the car for non responsive steering and again I disagree.  The car feels nimble and smooth weaving in and out of traffic.  My previous car was a 6 cylinder Infiniti g35 this car feels faster and more agile and does 10mpg better fuel efficiency.  I did one long trip out the car on comfort ride and did 33mpg averaging around 75 mph.   One thing I think could be better is the engine auto off... It's very noticable and the car feels like its stalling .   It can be shut off but I assume it will effect fuel economy.\",\n",

       "  \" Loved my Lexus and Infiniti cars, but the A4 tops them both. I can't review reliability yet, as I've only had the car for a month. My brother loved mine so much that he bought one the next week. Extra bonus: getting an average of 30 mpg and my insurance actually went DOWN $400 a year, presumably because of all the safety features in the car.\",\n",
       "  \" I had a '13 BMW 320i with Dinan Stage 1 and M Sport(with 6speed manual). It was really a fun car, with enough power and great dynamics. Since I was getting older, and my wife needed an automatic and was sitting in traffic a lot, we decided to get an automatic with more linear power(read I6/V6). Shopped around for Lexus IS350 and BMW 340i. 340i was good, but moving from manual to automatic, I didn't find the transmission react fast enough for my tastes. IS350 with its 8-speed transmission was also not as responsive. So I started looking for vehicles with dual-clutch given faster shift times and better response. Audi A4 is one of the few cars in the market with 7 speed DCT in the price range and new 2.0T motor is torque rich and in fact I found the vehicle better than sportier S3. Also even the base trim(Premium) has the Android Auto/Apple Play combo negating the need for nav package(mine has Convenience package, which is a must-have). And Quattro with rear-bias is another feature worth paying for. All in all, I got almost 5K off sticker on a brand-new vehicle which is a way better deal than BMW 328i(RWD),  Lexus IS300(AWD) and Acura TLX-V6 SH-AWD which are way out of Audi's league in terms of responsiveness and ride quality. Handling is little better in BMW, but everything else is dated. Previous Audis never impressed me, but this vehicle is quite a revelation and definitely worth considering if you are in market for entry level sporty-luxury sedans. At least until Lexus and BMW move to next generation, Audi seems to the best all-rounder in the segment.\",\n",
       "  ' I bought the prestige over the premium because i wanted the driver assist option. i compared to Bmw 3 and 4 series and Mercedes c class.

       "  \" This is my first Audi.  Before buying I drove a BMW 328i xdrive and a Mercedes c class.  They were all very nice cars but I fell for the Audi and love it.  Most of the complaints that I read are about the shifter and the way you have to put it in Park, but I think that Audi got that right.  It is easy and intuitive.  I don't understand the people that complain about it.  It works so much better than the conventional system.  It is so quiet inside.  The ride is fantastic.  Handles great.  My son borrowed it for a couple days.  He told me that on his way home from work he found himself taking the longest route available so he could just drive it longer.  It's the first car I've had that when I have nothing to do, I just take it and go for a drive.\",\n",

I wasn't too thrilled, he had a 1985 Audi when we first married, and it wasn't very reliable.  Imagine my surprise when I test drove a 2012 Q5.  It was fabulous, never had any trouble with it, decent gas mileage and was fun to drive.  After 4.5 years with my Q5 I felt like it was time to trade it in while I had a lot of equity in it (Retained its value very well )  The new A4 was just starting to be talked about.  I test drove one of the first ones my dealership got, and feel in love.  It handles exceptionally well, I can zip around those land yachts!  I am equally impressed with the gas mileage - about 30 mpg in mixed trips.  It is a different feeling getting in a car lower than a SUV, but I have gotten used to it.

       "  ' I\\'ve had my 2017 A4 quattro Prestige for 3 weeks now. I love this car. First time I\\'ve had an Audi I\\'m coming out of a 2014 BMW 428i coupe. This car is light years ahead of the BMW in terms of technology. The car my dealer had on the lot had the full tech and driver assistance packages. I wasn\\'t planning to get all of these features but I got a great price on the car and I do love the features. The heads-up display is awesome. I love the highly customizable LED interior lighting too. The virtual cockpit along with large center screen are so amazingly clear and easy to use. I love how well thought out the graphics are. The fit and finish inside is very good everything from the paint finish to the seams inside and out. No rattles or anything. The front seats (which my car has the warm weather package and in Florida that\\'s a must) are very comfortable. Love the design, headlights, tail lights, grille, wheels on my Prestige with gray/silver 2 tone. This car looks so sharp, literally. If I had to give anything that could use improvement, and this is really hard, I\\'d say: the bang and olufsen stereo doesn\\'t sound as good as my Harman Kardon system in my BMW. I\\'ve played with the sound settings and when playing certain songs on the radio there\\'s a \\'tinny\\' sound to mid and high tones I can\\'t get rid of. Only other thing is the sport seat any model has the side bolsters on the lower cushion are hard to come into contact with while entering the car. I hope over time these don\\'t show premature wear and tear. But, as a 6\\'3\" driver I have plenty of room in this car both leg and headroom. The trunk is spacious too and I love the 40/40/20 split folding seats. This probably won\\'t be my last Audi based on my experience this far!',\n",

       "  ' I test drove a lot of cars (3-series, C300, GLC, XC60, Mazda6, Mini Clubman) before choosing the 2017 A4 and so far, I really enjoy the car. Right now, I think it offers the best mix of tech, performance and luxury in the class, at least until the next 3-series or whatever leapfrogs it. Pros: - The tech goodies are really impressive. Virtual Cockpit is fantastic and having the nav right in front of you in a huge display is actually very useful. It\\'s easy to learn the basic functions of the infotainment system, but it is worth the time to dig deeper and really understand all the different ways you can customize the experience. It makes the car a lot more enjoyable. Even with all the tech, the usability is much better than Mercedes and Lexus. Honestly, you really need to get the technology package to get the best out of this car. - Beyond the gadgets, this is a very good driver\\'s car. Acceleration and braking are very strong, especially with quattro. The ride is firm but controlled. The steering is lighter than I would prefer though. - The interior is not as rich as the C-Class and the GLC, but the materials are high quality, visibility is excellent and the look is very clean and modern. I am 6\\'2\" with really broad shoulders and size 14 feet, and I have enough head and legroom in the front. I did not fit well at all in the C300, IS and Jaguar XE. The 3 series also has a pretty roomy cabin.- It doesn\\'t use run-flats and has an actual spare tire. I never cared until my wife and I both had flats last year. I had a spare tire. She didn\\'t. I was able to get moving again. She had to get towed. Enough said. Cons: - Setting up the AudiConnect trial was a pain that required multiple phone calls and websites. I was told there were issues with both the new A4 and Q7. I work in tech, so I was able to muddle through this and get everything set up, but Audi really needs to improve the process. - Exterior styling is handsome, but too much like the last generation A4 and the current A3. It\\'s really difficult to tell them apart at first glance. It would have been nice if the new A4 was a little more distinctive- Interior storage could be better. I love the adjustable center armrest, which seems to be a VW/Audi signature, but it doesn\\'t fully cover the compartment, so you can\\'t store anything showy in there. The glovebox is also very small, but at least there is a deep compartment next to the steering wheel that can hold a decent amount of items. - I wish you didn\\'t have to pony up for the Prestige package to get the additional driver assist package. LA traffic would be a little less annoying with the dynamic cruise control, but cost aside, Prestige models are almost impossible to find on dealer lots right now, and good luck getting a color other than black or white. - With all the new tech, I hope long-term reliability isn\\'t an issue.',\n",
       "  \" First of all, let me tell you that I loved driving my 2013 BMW 328xi, it was a fully loaded sports edition car, loved the acceleration, handling and looks! my only issue with it are the run flat tires that after 30K miles starter making a noise comparable to a bad bearing, but even with that, since my lease was coming to an end, the shopping began and I was certain I was going to get another BMW.Although this time was not as crazy to get the fully loaded version since there where soooooo many features that I've never used and just payed for them any ways, this time around I was just looking for the car with the features I enjoy: Moon roof, sports wheels, heated seats, leather interiors, and that is it. Obviously, BMW car dealers only had cars with most of the high end stuff and even that we were able to find the right car, the price tag was high since wanted to stick to the 240 Hp of the 328 vs the 180hp of the 320.My wife owns an Audi Q5 and we happened to be in the dealer for a service and started to look around the brand new Audi A4 and learned about the upgrades on the design and technology and fell in love with the new car.This model comes with a 252hp engine, 0-60 in 5.8 sec and driving modes that made me forgot my intentions to buy another BMW.Some of the Pros that I see vs BMW:1. Tires (of course)2. Value. you get a 328 kind of performance with a 320 price tag3. Car play. Love the integration with your smart phone4. Space.5. The premium model it was perfectly packed to my needs, only thing I didn't need but is included is the rear view camera and got a credit for its cost!6. More comfortable than the BMW. Although sporty, it rides extremely well!The only minor thing that I have notice is that there is a little bit of reaction time when you press the accelerator, but once is going is pretty amazing.3 years ago I test drove an A4 before getting my 328 and there were not even close, and while purist may say that BMW performance is better I will say that you get 95% of the BMW with 85% of the cost which to me is a pretty good value for your money\",\n",

       "  \" A complete redesigned A4 reaches new levels of technology and luxury.  The technology in this winner is state of the art.  I almost feel like I need to go back to school and get an IT degree to get the most out of this amazing vehicle.  Apple Car Play works like a charm the minute you plug into the designated USB port in the glove box.  For you Android people it also handles Google Play (or whatever the comparable technology is named).  The ability to load the Nav system where you would normally find your speed and RPM dials gives you the feel that you are the pilot in a 747.  Speaking of the Nav system it is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned or system used.  That includes Honda, Acura and Garmin.   So many electronic gadgets that I urge you to check out this magnificent machine online.   I am also surprised at how well it does on mpg -- I got 31.5 on highway driving.  I'm sure that will even improve on a longer trip.  Very pleased with this purchase.  My sales rep at Audi Natick, Kevin Schuster, was great.  Only drawback is it takes premium fuel, but with this high performance engine it's worth it.  The 2017 A4 is a winner in every way.\",\n",
       "  \" The new A4 design is a redesigned automobile based somewhat on the Audi Q7 cabinet.  Audi was smart enough to keep somewhat of the same exterior design. They were smart enough to add technology to the interior cabinet in place of big outside body changes.   With that said, the inside cabinet has totally changed - for the BETTER. There is more room and comfort, better placement of hand controls, a well-placed cup holder, and three very smart user display areas across the center console, driver dashboard, and windshield .  Compared to the previous model, it is a comfortable rocketship with added safely technology and conveniences surrounding the entire cabinet, including the heated back seats.  The only big drawback is the Apple CarPlay needs to be connected via a cable and not via wireless bluetooth. Yes, we are Apple iPhone users.  Another concern is BMW, Mercedes, and other car manufacturers moving away from Apple, since they are supposedly building their own car line. My questions are: will Audi stay up-to-date with Apple upgrades and changes, or move away?  And even if they stay with Apple or Android, can these new designs - Apple CarPlay and their GPS accept a software upgrade?   In regards to the new A4, I would recommend it.  The changes are enough to get me to the showroom. Hats off to the online marketing department.  In regard to price, it is pricer with all the new option stuff. In closing, I will probably buy one in June because my wife loves her A4, I love her, and it's time to trade up.   Good luck with the car hunting!\",\n",

I really only have one complaint: the engine auto-stop/auto-start is a big hesitant, and although it's trivial to disable it, you can't change the default setting. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect. I've done several long runs on rough/choppy pavement, and it handles it well. One of the proximity sensors needed resetting after driving through torrential (post-hurricane) rain; no big deal.\",\n",

Light weight and fun to throw into corners, drives like a luxury go-kart. Google Earth is simply amazing, navigation/controls took me about a week to master, now seem very intuitive and make other cars feel dated. Magnetic ride suspension gives the car a near luxury ride in Comfort mode for longer drives. I feel a better value than Cayman, which prices out $10K - $15K more with similar equipment. Back seats for kids only, fold flat for surprising amount of room (yes, the golf clubs fit easily). Give it a look when shopping M2, M4\\'s and Porsche.

She's nimble on windy roads with minimal body roll, and is quite sure-footed in snow, (Pirelli snow tires; though one does need to avoid sudden jolts, with this many horses). The noted 0-60 speed has prob been underestimated. Acceleration is smooth throughout the power band, with only a hint of initial turbo lag. My only complaint, if there is one, is lack of standard transmission. The paddle shifters just aren't the same, but in reality the automatic mode (in Sport setting) shifts at all the proper points. Love that the dynamic mode shifts this car to rear-wheel bias with the touch of a button/also impacts cornering and these differences are noticeable to the driver. Plus, suspension changes can be immediately felt to dampen a rough road, if needed.\",\n",

       "  \" !!AVOID THIS MODEL!!! - Backstory : Based on a good amount of research it was hard to deny the overall positive press this model was getting. I had a 2012 528i that was out of warranty and have had BMW’s since my early 20's so when the lease incentives hit bargain basement levels, I jumped in. Sadly, I should have remembered a life preserver.Month 1 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 2 - 2 weeks out of service - hybrid battery/charging system warningMonth 3 - 2 days out of service - hybrid battery/cold weather use warning.So, 2.2 months, over a month out of service total. Great start to my ownership experience.However, it gets worse. We have had very cold temperatures over the last two weeks, even for where I live in Richmond, VA. Days and nights well below freezing. I get that batteries don’t retain full charge in cold weather, but this one was only charging about 80% max and depleted even that very quickly...that is...when it actually allowed for electric operation. You see, what they don’t tell you is that the fully battery operation is not available in lower temperatures! Yep, that’s right. So, for all you who, like me, thought you could pretty much commute via full battery, well....guess what, ya can’t when it is cold out! Sad part is, this is considered normal according to my dealership. What burns my ass up even more is that a warning light stays lit on your dash and on your Nav screen to remind you that you paid $$$$ for a system you can’t use.Other things they don’t tell you - - -This is a 320e at best. You are going to deplete your battery relatively quickly (14 miles max in full electric mode) and once depleted, guess what? You aren’t running on 248 advertised horsepower, you are running on 180....with several hundred pounds on top of a similar 320i model! Battery regeneration isn’t enough for spirited driving or even multiple full throttle launches back to back! So, BMW has pulled the wool over my eyes, just don’t let it do the same to you.Other things I have found out by myself - - -$575 for side window sun shades? WTH? They are MANUAL!$2650 for Blind Spot/Lane Departure/and Frontal Impact Warning and a front/rear parking camera/sensor system with around view camera? Have they lost their MINDS?!? Worse yet, all you are paying for is warning lights and a shake of the steering wheel! Ridiculous and a waste of money unless you live urban and park on the street.So, as of this writing BMW USA has contacted me because they know that the cold driving issues (no full electric power) are an issue along with the horsepower claims.  It should say 248 MAX hp, because it is rare that you have it to use.  I have asked them to take it back.  A little over two months of disappointment.\",\n",

After test driving the car a few times I decided to transition from my 328i into an X1 as I was looking for more space and comfort. After driving off the lot and sitting in the car for 15 minutes I immediately noticed the seat was off. THESE ARE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SEATS. The driver's seat is now causing me BACK PAIN which I've had to visit a chiropractor to help manage.

Decided to cancel my extended warranty as it was clear to me that I wasn't going to keep this car beyond it's factory warranty period, even though the factory warranty turned out to be pretty useless anyway. I followed the cancellation instructions as provided in the booklet and it took seven months to get my money back and they shorted me $350 despite California law prohibiting any deductions if cancelled within the time frame that I did it.

Three different paint experts said this was a systemic problem with the paint application at the manufacturing plant.  The dealership replaced the gas cap lid but refused to address the other issues.  Their reasoning was that those same splotches were evident on other X5M's.

I especially like the dashboard design, the instrumentation and the interior lighting.  I had been shopping for months for an X3 with the upgraded Harmon Kardon sound system because the base sound system is lousy, especially for a premium vehicle such as the X3.  I found one, a nice \\'17 model with only 11K miles (the salesman couldn\\'t tell me where the car came from, whether it was traded in or an off-lease, which I found surprising).  I took it for a test drive, then I negotiated a decent price.  During the test drive, I noticed the ride was firm, but it didn\\'t seem overly so.  The X3 comes with either Goodyear or Pirelli tires, and the ones with the Goodyear tires seem to ride a bit smoother, although both brands are run-flat tires since the X3 doesn\\'t come with a spare.  During the time I was signing papers, I was surprised to find out that the warranty is very limited and in fact, they give you a four-page document listing everything that is NOT covered.  That was kind of an eye-opener.  Once I signed all the papers, I spent about 40 minutes with a young man who reviewed all the options and features with me.  It was a bit overwhelming, but I figured with time it would all make sense.  Once I left the lot, the trouble started.  The first thing I noticed was that I felt every crack and bump in the road.  The ride was jarring and uncomfortable.  Then, once I hit about 70MPH on the highway, I heard a whistling sound coming from the area of the sunroof.  Uh-oh.  \"Is this why it was traded in so soon\", I wondered.  Then, I tried to listen to a song from my iPhone, but it wouldn\\'t play,  I fiddled with every logical option to get it to play, but no luck.  I was miserable, thinking I had made a big mistake trading in my trusty \\'13 RAV4 for this rough-rider.  Once I got home, I sat in the driveway and wondered what to do.  Would I get used to it or was a making a compromise that would prove difficult to live with?  I decided the latter and promptly returned to the dealership.  Luckily, they had not registered it in my name yet, so after some probing questions from the salesman and the manager, they refunded my deposit, tore up the paperwork and gave me back my RAV4.

Every time you start the vehicle, it will come back to annoy you – first with a legal disclaimer and then an array of meaningless menu choices.  It’s impossible to make the screen display something useful like a digital clock (a Kia will do that, but a BMW won’t).  I’d settle for a BMW logo on the screen, but even that’s not an option.The menu is loaded with choices leading quickly to lots of useless information, but changing the audio source for the stereo is 3-4 clicks and a couple of knob-spins away.

If there is any traffic on the highway they will not activate.Cons: - Biggest disappointment for my 72K car is the engine. Base engine is barely adequate. The 6 cylinder engine will struggle to move the car. I have never had a car that goes over 6000 RPM to the red zone every time I merge to the highway. Do not expect sporty performance.- LED headlight are cool looking, have whiter shade than HIDs, and they may last longer but they are not any brighter than HIDs on other cars. They are not worth the extra money.- The hand break does not engage well. The car will always roll down a few inches after stopping the engine, even in park and engaging the hand break. I park on slightly steep drive and I never with this issue. - The electric shift knob is not precise. You will not feel the shifts. It does not have the secure click like in my Mercedes. I must take my eyes off the road to make sure I am in the right gear, or I will be revving the engine in neutral, or moving when I was supposed to be in neutral. - The button that activate and deactivate auto shut off when stopped is too small and too close to ignition. The problem is that they are both hidden under the steering wheel, you may push both with your thumb if you do not look and then you would have the engine shutoff unexpectedly on the first stop. - The A/C is very weak. I never had to put the A/C on MAX cold in any car before and I do not like strong A/C. It might be fine if you live in the northern states. I live in the south and the A/C will only be fine on cooler days. On hot days, exactly when you need it, it will take 30-minute highway drive on MAX cold to cool off the car. - The blind spot monitor only works on relatively high speed, I believe something like 30 miles/hr. It is not useful in busy slower traffic.- The seats are not comfortable. I have the higher-end seats they can be adjusted in many ways. I can never find them comfortable. - There is a front camera which I was excited to see. I thought it would help to see what is right in front when you park. It is absolutely useless.

       "  ' I wasn\\'t even thinking about the BMW 3 series -- I was looking at the GS350 FSport (MT gave it a glowing review!),  the Giulia (CR\\'s example seemed to live in the shop from day one), S6 (close to M5 speed but much less expensive), ATS-V, GT350, used Cayman. My goal was to replace my RX-8 R3, mainly because I want to have my family of 5 all fit in the fun car, and the RX-8\\'s constant need to downshift was not fun anymore after 5 trouble-free years. Therefore I quickly ruled out the Cayman, GT350, as well as then ATS-V sedan (kids still need boosters, and most have a very wide bottom).  I drove the S6 first. It\\'s such a quick car, the dual clutch was fast and smooth, and the interior was such a nice place to be! However, it is realistically a $78k car with some options, and it did not feel like a $78k car. Then the GS350 FSport -- it drove like a slightly updated version of my 2009 G37 -- little more numb, cool new gadgets to play with, same acceleration, ridiculously difficult to use \"mouse\" controller. It wasn\\'t even that quiet cruising on the highway, which was supposed to be THE highlight of a Lexus. Then I thought I\\'d go for the M3, but happened to see a 340i xDrive at the same dealer, with a STICK! It was $64k sticker, with red leather, M Sport Trim, bunch of driver aides and tech stuff. Edmunds\\' own long-term 340i seemed to garner mostly positive reviews, so I was excited and tested it.  I won\\'t bore you with all the details of the purchase experience, but they knocked $9k off (nobody knows how to drive stick anymore?), decent deal on the RX-8, and made me wait over an hour to \"prep and detail\" the car.  The biggest impressions so far, after about 500 miles: 1. The M Sport steering wheel is VERY nice, looks great (I stare at it far more than the exterior of the car, so exterior styling ranks very low in my book) and feels nice in the hands. 2. The clutch uptake is lazy (I am coming out of an RX-8, so this may not be fair to the BMW, but I hate it). 3. The gearing is wayyy too tall (performance of the manual tested elswhere is quite a bit slower than Edmund\\'s long-term 340i auto), so despite the mountains of low-end torque, it doesn\\'t give you that \"kick\" on takeoff. 4. The suspension is MAGICAL -- it stays relatively flat in corners but still soaks up bumps well. In contrast, the G37\\'s suspension is firm enough to make the ride uncomfortably busy on New England roads, but does not keep it as flat while cornering. The GS350 is slightly better. Only the S6 is similar. 5. Getting on the gas out of a corner is so much fun, and the AWD system inspires a lot of confidence! 6. The steering is the same for the 340 as the S6 as the GS350. They are all pretty accurate, all very numb, and the \"sport\" setting just add effort without making it any more accurate or giving it any feedback. I agree with another reviewer here about the huge difference in handling compared to previous generations of BMWs -- I drove a 2009 328 xDrive when it was new (first time driving a BMW), and immediately was knocked over by the handling! I realized what all the fuss was about! 7. Nobody ever compliments the 3 series for how quiet it is inside.   In then end, I went for the 340i because it felt like it was at least 80% as capable as the S6, had the same bland handling, had a manual that wasn\\'t available with the S6, so it was a much better value. Again, the ATS-V was out of the question because the back seats are too small for 3 kids with boosters; the Giulia consistently showed major quality issues that will ruin your driving experience (MT had an article about stranding in the middle of an intersection!!!); every other 5-seater had the same boring steering; so, I never thought I\\'d say this, but the BMW was a great value!',\n",

       "  \" I got a manual transmission 330i.  It's a great car that is actually addictive to drive, but it's that comfortable and it's technology is lacking a little and you pay too much for options that are usually standard on much cheaper cars.  As an example, you don't get Android auto at all, you don't get easy access or lumbar support unless you buy the premium package.  You don't get a blind point assist as well.\",\n",
       "  \" I have mixed feelings about this car, and considering the premium you pay to drive a BMW, mixed feelings don't make it.  I lease the car as a daily driver, and drive a 2008 Corvette Z06 for fun.  I wanted a stick so I wouldn't get bored, and I wanted the four because the sixes feel heavy and not particularly sporty.  Even the previous-gen used M3s I drove felt lacking:  all muscle and no soul.  This is my fourth BMW in the last six years, and while each has had its strong points, they don't feel like the Bimmers I test-drove back in the '90s.  They're heavier, as are virtually all cars these days, and they've tilted so much toward refinement that they feel almost like a Benz.  But in its quest for refinement, BMW doesn't seem to have put much effort into the clutch and shifter.  The clutch can be abrupt.  When new, the shifter was rubbery and would frequently hang up.  Now that it's worn in a bit, it's smoother but still hangs occasionally, and it feels almost as clunky and Mattel-like as the shifter in the '89 Olds Cutlass International I owned years ago.  Given the customer take rate for sticks of one percent or so (Edmunds doesn't even offer a user review category for 3 series with stick) I can understand why BMW may not care much about clutch and shifter smoothness, but it's the last BMW stick I'll get, and probably the last BMW.  At least I've figured out how to drive the car:  like I stole it.  Drive it normally and you travel through (and occasionally dwell in) the Valley of Turbo Lag that's right off idle, lag you don't feel in an automatic because the torque converter masks the weak throttle response at very low RPM.  I had the same problem with a 2008 C300 with stick that I bought new--off the line the throttle feels like an on/off switch.  It's a fun sports sedan when put in sport mode and driven hard on a back road.  But drive it in traffic and it's actually more challenging to drive smoothly than my Z06--more challenging even than the STI I test-drove, a car not known for its smoothness.  And the STI felt far sportier.  BMW still does fine engineering, but in my experience it focuses these days on the mainstream customer, not the enthusiast looking for a nimble sports sedan.\",\n",
       "  \" I have had this car for a month.  I am still not used to the quieting of the motor at stops and then kicking in when accelerating.  Storage console is very small and I like to have things at hand.  Where do I store my CDs?  Compartment not big enough for this.  Hairbrush doesn't fit.  Turn signal is also something I am slow to get used to.  The car is just the right size for me and so far so good.\",\n",
       "  \" This is a small SUV, but it holds me very well, 6'3 255lbs. This small version of an SUV has an comfortable ride, a little stiff for some, but not for BMWers. It handles very very well. Superior acceleration for a 4cyl engine. Good visibility all the way around.This X1 is fully loaded, but a blind spot monitor was not available at any cost. It must be the only BMW without that option. Why? I think the BSP is a great option, it has saved me a couple of times from cutting somebody off or even an accident that would have been my fault. My wife drives the car mostly, and she loves it. Small enough so that she can park and maneuver around things fairly easily, but large enough to feel like you have some metal between you and the other idiots who drive so nutsy on our local roads. I find the interior of the X1 a little inferior in quality materials from other BMW's, still good stuff, but somehow it seems a little weak for a BMW. The technology and especially the layout of the interior is the best there is, anywhere. We test drove the Audi Q3, Lexus NX, BMW was a clear winner over these two comparable models. I would give this BMW 4.5 stars if not for the lacking BSP. It only gets 4 as is. My 2006 M3 convertible soft top is still my favorite, it gets a 5 along with my Porsche Macan S, the only two cars I have ever given a 5 rating to, and I have owned LOTS of high end cars and SUV's. Cheers............... Update......... 6 months in, very happy with the car. My wife drives it mostly and she loves it. Perfect size and good fuel economy for all the running around she does.\",\n",
       "  ' I have been leasing this car for 1.5 years and I have 16,000 miles on it (about 65% highway, 35% city driving).  WHY LEASING? I wanted to buy, but everyone told me that I am crazy and that BMWs tend to have lots of problems as soon as the warranties expire.  Is that true? Perhaps not and I am sure how one drives them and cares for them has a lot to do with the issue, but I felt uncomfortable and so I got a high-mileage lease which costs me a lot, true be told. A professional at Honda, during a conversation we had (my second car is a Honda) told me that \"BMW will last, but maintenance does not come cheap!\" That is the real issue: does one want to be stuck in expensive maintenance? Each of us has his or her own answer to this.  IS IT REALLY THE ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE? No. Period. Perhaps, if one gets the X5 M, but the 6-cylinder X5 with 300 hp and 4700 lb of weight is just good for 0-60mph in 6 seconds. Nobody gets overly impressed by that. Visibility is good, but not great and even maniacs who drive in and out of lanes have to pay a lot of attention. Sure, in Sport Mode, it is on the fun side, I will admit to that and on occasions I hit the canyons around here and push it  and have fun, but for everyday use it is not a dream come true.   IS IT COMFORTABLE? The basic seats for me are ugly and as uncomfortable as they get. In fact, my Honda\\'s seats are more comfortable! However I upgraded the seats to the next level (cannot do the top trim as they only come in ivory white which I do not like for my daily ride) and things improved more than a bit.  The rear seats are not bad at all for rear seats, however. Quite good.  DOES IT HANDLE WELL? Yes, it does. That I must admit.. Even at 90mph or more on canyons, the car has an excellent behavior for such heavy vehicle. I have the Dynamic handling package as well though.  OPTIONS. That is the best part about purchasing or leasing a BMW, i.e. most is customizable a la carte unlike other brands in the same segment.  EXPENSIVE TO OWN? As it is a lease and I am under warranty, no. But fuel economy, while good for the segment, is nothing to brag about. I am getting on average 22 mpg. I can get 26mpg on highway alone (mine is the 4 wheel drive model), however in city driving I feel like I want to cry. I am lucky if I get 17 mpg, probably 16 mpg more like it. WOULD I BUY/LEASE IT AGAIN? Tough. Leasing is not my thing, I like the cars to be mine and keep them forever. The warranty program for me is weak. I would like 6 years or 100k miles. If a brand does not do that, to me it means they do not believe in their vehicles as I would like them to. That is at the of the day, my real issue: I am ok to pay more for a vehicle but, if I take care of it, it should hardly ever have any issue. Like my Honda CR-V, 21 years together, 303k miles on it and never a major issue. Fun is good, but reliability is  very desirable as well. HOW WAS IT DEALING WITH BMW DEALERS? Pleasant, surprisingly very pleasant. I am confident that it varies from dealer to dealer, but my experience was A+.  I did rent the car for 4 days before purchasing so I knew how it drives, the positives and the negatives and all I had to do was to select the options I needed/wanted and deal on price. Mine was custom ordered as I am picky on colors and combinations of interiors/exteriors, but dealer worked with me and never rushed me.  WHAT DO I REALLY THINK THE 6 cylinder X5 needs? Either to lose some weight or gain another 50 hp (without fuel consumption go higher), then it would be near perfect.  Brakes could be a bit more powerful too. Stopping this vehicle in tight spaces, is not a breeze. On 405 Freeway, there was an accident in the car pool lane and I was traveling on it... I kept a reasonable distance, but with the delays in braking.. I came within inches of hitting the car in front.  Downhill braking always does not feel very powerful. Other than that, so far thumbs up.',\n",
       "  \" Fun too drive.  Supet quiet.  Zero emissions.  After this great experience with first electric car, I don't think I could go back to another internal combustion vehicle.  Electric range of  200+ miles and a 5th seat would make it perfect.\",\n",
       "  ' We have had our X1 2017 for 14 months. Positive comments include terrific pick up, unencumbered interior, a nice tight turning radius, a huge panoramic moon roof [option], bold styling ,outstanding heater/air conditioning and a good value for a new Beemer. As well, if living in a colder climate, DO spring for the heated front seats and steering wheel. They are worth every penny. Lastly, in 2017 many options were standalone so the cost was individualized, not part of a more expensive package.Needed improvements include 1.MUCH more comfortable front seats. Our options included sport seats after reading the consumer reviews, which were right on. Even the sport seats are narrow and very firm. We have had 5 other Beemers and never had an issue with the seat comfort. 2. Considerable road noise. We have 19\" upgraded tires[run flat] and they might contribute to the level of noise. 3. BE CAREFUL!! The \\'sliding rear seat\\' option does provide for more cargo room[ about 4 \"] but since the regular position of the rear seat without the option almost abuts the rear wheel well already, you only gain about an inch of additional rear legroom by paying for this option. It\\'s simply not worth it unless additional cargo room is a priority. I am 6\\' 3\" and need to move the front seat all the way back, leaving a tight area for legroom behind my driver\\'s seat. BMW did curtail their warranty so be advised that items covered in the past now cost the consumer[e.g. windshield wipers replacement during scheduled service- standard in the past... over $30.00 EACH now] The length of the warranty has been modified as well.   UPDATE.....The X1 is built in Germany, unlike the X3 and 5. I took a sleighride with our X1 this past winter and quickly discovered that the Potenza tires were exclusively SUMMER tires . Be advised that I believe Germany does not recognize all season tires- only summer or winter. I was informed that winter tires are required and cars without them can be ticketed in Germany. SO....IF that is accurate, since we ordered our car from Germany in April, it came equipped with summer tires. We will be switching to all season within the next year. Lastly, the Potenza tires, while enabling the car to maneuver well does not appear to wear well. At 17,00 miles, the tread is 3/4 gone....NOT impressive.',\n",
       "  \" This is my first BMW after three years in a Subaru Outback 3.6R.  I'm a guy who likes to get pushed back in my seat when I step on the gas, so I'm always looking for a way to balance that need with fuel use.  The Subaru's 6 gave me the acceleration I want and generally I loved the Outback but found the fuel economy very disappointing.  I live in Brooklyn, NY - so just think traffic that is about as tough on fuel economy as you get.  So at the end of my lease, I test drove an X1 figuring that the turbo 4 gave me a chance to have my cake (acceleration) and eat it too (decent gas mileage).  That theory is paying off so far.  The X1 is quick and nimble - probably a half second faster - to 60 than the 3.6R and my gas mileage is averaging about 4 - 5 mpg better and much better on the highway.  I drove the car on a 1300 mile trip down the east coast and back and averaged just about 30 mpg (80 mile per hour on cruise control most of the way). The Outback never approached that kind of fuel efficiency.  The Outback did have more room in the cabin especially for the rear seat passengers (my now grown kids are complaining about comfort on longer trips).  The 3.6R also had a smoother ride over bumpy roads as the X1's stiffness and added sportiness comes at the cost of a smooth ride.  But the slightly smaller length and width of the X1 is a big benefit when parking - especially on the street.  I think for me the X1 beats the Outback in most of the other categories that matter to me - aesthetics too.  My only other beefs would be the bluetooth entertainment system and the driver memory settings (it can supposedly store at least 2).  To this day we can't figure out why the bluetooth bounces between mine and my wife's phone when we are both in the car and we prefer using waze on our phones to the navigation that comes with the X1 - so with bluetooth connection - consistency matters.  It also is irritating that if your phone is connected wirelessly and then you decide to connect it to the usb - the car disconnects and you have to reconnect.  Finally - For some reason the car keeps losing my settings when I select them - so I'm planning on going back to the dealership to see what's up with that.  I'm a pretty picky person, so I don't want the gripes to make readers think I'm not happy with the car - overall it's one of the best car's I've owned and a very good value for the dough.\",\n",
       "  ' We had a leased 2015 X1 whose lease was up and opted to go inot a 2017 X1.  Our \\'15 was 12K miles over the agreement and BMW let us out of the lease early and forgave the extra miles, so it was the best path.  The \\'17 X1 is a different car then the \\'15 model year.  The seats are smaller/shorter and are not as comfortable for me, a 5\\'10\", 150# male, but for my wife, a petite 5\\'1\" 110# female they are great.  She likes the seating position more than the \\'15 X1.  IMO, the interior is cheaper than before.  For example, the shifter is a simpler analog type vs. the electric fly by wire on the \\'15 model.  The buttons and switches, while still of high quality are noticeably different in feel.  Our model has the iDrive knob/buttons in the center console, no nav, and is OK, but a distraction, IMO.  To the positive, the turbo charged engine has plenty of power, and brakes are good.  I really like the LED headlights, they put out a nice bright white light.  The cabin noise is about the same as the \\'15, and is I believe, affected by the OEM tires used by the factory.  Overall, BMW says this is the lowest cost Bimmer, and on this count they are right, they accomplish this feat by using cheaper components.  We have been a BMW family for 15+ years owning 7s, Z3, Z4, 535i, X3 (still owned and going strong with 118K on the odometer) and 2 X1s, so I am a bit conflicted that they are producing such entry level cars.  It is becoming harder to rationalize BMWs cost premium for this class when there are so many other competitive SUVs on the market.',\n",

I buy BMW partly due to driving experience, BMW missed a great opportunity to show us a front drive could feel like a BMW, this does not, don´t get me wrong it is a great car, my wife likes it better, says it is more comfortable, and it is, but seat of the pants does not feel as good, it just does not feel 100% BMW due mostly to transmission personality.',\n",
       "  \" previous owner of earlier bmw's, mini cooper S', porsche and ferrari, as well as a slew of others, I am compelled to disagree with earlier gentleman' statement about harsher ride, this X-1 we bought precisely because as a small cross-over this rides impeccably well, so much more than we ever anticipated, which is why we bought it! Keep it out of sport mode!  Or not I use it for performance purposes, my spouse does not, the choice is ours to make. We looked at four door clubman, f-pace jags, MB slams & c's, none do what this car does especially for the price, none!\",\n",
       "  \" We shopped around for quite some time looking for a small/midsize crossover. We test drove literally dozens of vehicles: Mazda, Audi, Benz, Honda, Ford, to name a few. We were between the Volvo XC 60 and the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. We loved the Volvo but the price at $52K out the door was a little more than we were willing to pay. We were about to settle on the Hyundai (even though it didn't drive especially well) when the night before I read an article about the X1 and figured we'll go check it out before settling on the Hyundai. To our delight, we loved the way the X1 looked, drove, and its interior is bigger than it seems from the outside. The trunk was the biggest surprise to us with the underneath compartment. We loved the car. We compromised on the base X-Drive model MSRP of $36K but got them down to $33K. We took it home that night and have been enjoying it ever since. Nearly 1 month later, we have gotten a good feel for the X1. Our biggest complaints have to do with some basic features lacking in the base model which we knew going in. The fully loaded Hyundai had all the features I'm talking about i.e. LED Headlights, XM Radio, Blind Spot monitoring, Sunroof, backup camera, adaptive cruise, forward collision warning, integrated sunshades, heated seats, navigation to name some big ones. The X1 does have some of these features if you elect certain packages but the price will quickly climb into the 40's and beyond. Ultimately, we chose the BMW because it drove 100 times better than the Hyundai and at the end of the day, no matter how much you dress up a Hyundai it is still a Hyundai and drives as such. We've been averaging 25MPG combined which is better than all the other vehicles we tried especially with an all-wheel drive. Besides our lack of options our only other complaint really is the suspension. As expert reviewers have stated, the X1's suspension is very stiff and you feel it when you go over speed bumps or bumps in the road. But I still prefer the stiffness over the squishyness of the Hyundai's body roll suspension. Another weird thing our X1 lacks is the ability to control the rear dome light from the rear. It's an odd design flaw but we'll get over it. Ultimately, we are very pleased with our decision.\",\n",
       "  \" I really love the looks, driving, and performance of this car.  Mileage is fantastic with the hybrid system.  I can drive to and from work on total electric power leading to a combined MPGe of 68.  However, the hybrid system has some issues with cold weather.  It often won't allow total electric driving and doesn't show the range available on electric power.  Also, the system isn't charging to its full range.\",\n",
       "  \" Poor performance, the engine loses all power when I turn a corner at an intersection and I just sit there for a few seconds waiting to go anywhere. Turbo lag is significant, I mash the pedal and for a few seconds nothing happens, throttle response is awful. I had an AWD MB SUV before this car and I could take turns faster in a car much, much heavier than I can in this, handling sucks. Car is way too low to the ground, the seats are the most uncomfortable car seat I've ever sat in, my feet go numb frequently because I can't get comfortable. Interior quality is awful, but then I suspect it is with every BMW, interior trim and materials are already starting to flake and peel off after only 1.5 years of ownership. Cargo and storage is decent. Navigation has to be the worst nav on the market, I used Google Maps on my phone at the same time as the vehicle system and I've stopped using the car's nav as it frequently gets the directions or street names wrong. The included cell phone charging cradle in the center armrest is friggen retarded, the only way my phone fits is if I take the case off and who the hell wants to do that? It takes all of the storage from the center console, after this there is only enough room for a pack of gum without covering the USB port in here. And of course all the cars at dealerships have to come packaged with this dumb charger, have the folks at BMW ever used a modern cell phone before? What are they thinking? USB ports are in the worst place possible, you can't both plug something into a USB port and have usable storage or drinks in the cup holders. Climate control doesn't have a sync option which many cars at this level do. My parking assistant and aid frequently doesn't work and nearly every time I back up I get a warning telling me not to rely on it and back up on my own. The lack of android auto but inclusion of apple car play is confusing, why offer one and not the other? Use of Spotify via the BMW app is spotty (no pun intended), sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've had the car for 1.5 years and already had to replace the water pump, and after a few months of ownership one of the tires needed to be replaced, another $400 bucks down the drain. And now trying to get out of this damn lemon, my resale value is nearly half of what I originally paid for the car, went from $43,000 to $25,000 resale value in 1.5 years, now that is some depreciation! Long story short don't buy this car, get the A5 sportback which is a way better car, albeit for a bit more money.\",\n",
       "  \" Beautiful Car and GREAT to drive.  I ended up picking this mainly because I wanted a hard-top convertible with some power.  This car drives great, is comfortable, and great with the top down.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase but am a little annoyed by some things that don't make sense to me, a lot related to difficult function controls.  I've only had it about a month so part of this might be just adjusting to BMW ways.  First of all, it isn't possible to put this car into PARK without turning off the car.  So weird and annoying if you want to be SURE that it is in PARK.  It switches to park automatically if turning off the car in Drive or Reverse, but otherwise you can only put it into NEUTRAL and set the parking brake if you want to sit idle, or turn it off and turn it back on.  Also, the lack of touch for the screen interface is inefficient for entering addresses, and the finger spelling on the console control knob is not a good replacement--much easier to tap out a number on a screen than trace each individual number/letter.  Also, the volume control is only on the dash or on the right side of the steering wheel--this means if you have your hand on the console knob controlling your nav/media, driving with your left hand, you have to move your right hand from the console knob to the dash or the steering wheel.  The car has options for comfort suspension for daily driving but there isn't a way to make that a default--it always goes back to the more rigid SPORT option so that you have to reselect each time you start the car for COMFORT.  There are other little things like the toggle for the hard-top requires you to pull BACK to put the top UP/Forward, and push Forward to put the top down/back -- just not intuitive.  LOTS of media options but difficult to sort out.  Anyway, I'll stop with these things since overall it's a very nice car with AMAZING driving profile, which is what most people might be looking for and the little things might not matter.  It's my primary car so the daily use things are a little annoying to me.  As far as hard-topped convertible with power, I think this is the only good choice.  I was considering going Mercedes C63 Coupe but didn't test-drive it since I still wanted the convertible.\",\n",
       "  ' OK. Bottom line up front. I went from a fire breathing hairy chested mustached slightly off center BMW 135i with it\\'s twin turbo (1 turbo per 3 cans) 6 speed (proper gear box) 2 door sports car that didn\\'t have heated seats or steering wheel or rear view camera because real men don\\'t need heated seats and they really don\\'t care what is behind them because...well odds are you passed it which lasted me to 145k miles....tooooooo a......new to me 2017 BMW 425xi. Now lets compare the two cars! 1) When you turned on your 135i in the morning in your garage your knuckles grew fuzzy and your voice dropped an octave....that engine woke up!  And it woke up every fat American in your little town! When the 425 wakes up.....it\\'s like drinking a cup of DD....it\\'s \"coffee\"....it\\'s not ESPRESSO! 2) When you sat IN the 135i YOU SAT IN THE 135...I had the cheap fake black leather seats that were THE BEST SEATS I had ever sat in in my entire life! Everyone who ever sat in my car said the same thing...\"HOLY HELL\" I now sit in the 425 xi with it\\'s heated leather seats.....at 210lb i\\'m a \"skinny\" American and well this thing is as wide as a mom jeans wearing woman from Iowa who has a thing for mayo and stuffing and kale is the name of her bff not something you have in a salad. it has \"bolsters\" as in someone said they were there but well these seats are as flat as Kansas. You can manspread all you want in this car to hold your 140oz bladder buster from DD. 3) Transmission...I went from a 6 speed 3 pedal machine that switched gears like a sniper taking out rolly pollies at your local piglywigly to a 8 speed (really 8!) automatic / sport transmission that really thinks it\\'s connected to an inline 6 with two turbos rather than the 2L 4 caned handbag that sits under the hood. But that said the fit and finish on the new to me 2017 is actually good! the IDrive doesn\\'t wish to take us though the rougher parts of town to pick up copious amounts of narcotics and start bare knuckle fist fights like my old 135 use to do...and having an AWD car is nice.....but what would you know...you just Uber Eat\\'s a bucket of KFC with extra mashed potatoes and coleslaw with extra mayo from down the street! So over all very nice car, very well assembled and in white it actually looks very good during sunrise and sunset...has some very nice lines that just seem to show up and make you smile much like my old 135i did. The 2L turbo is a nice engine and the 8 speed transmission is nice when you drive it and push it past 3k rpm. But here is the deal if you had a 6Cyl BMW before and are thinking of saving the world and going with the 4..........don\\'t....it\\'s just not worth it........I\\'m not saying i\\'ll sell this car tomorrow and upgrade to the 6....i\\'ll learn how to grow up and be an \"adult\" and maybe i\\'ll even grow to actually be able to take a sip of DD and not spit it out and scream \"YOU CALL THIS COFFEE!\" but honestly ........ going from the 135i to the 425xi is like........well......how can I put it......my little 135i with it\\'s OZ racing wheels use to get little kids to point and go \"oooooohhhh\" while my 425xi with it\\'s stock wheels and it\\'s quiet engine gets cougars to look over and go \"oh my!\" now you may be into cougars.......and you may also like to drink DD and stuff your face with a pumpkin filled twice fried fritter.....and that\\'s ok.....but maybe you should have bought a Chevy?

       "  ' This is my second BMW convertible. My first was a 2008 328i. This new 2017 430i convertible is a very nice car with some improvements over the 2008 model but some disappointments also. First the good news. The 2 liter 4 cylinder dual turbo engine should satisfy most drivers. It has great pick up and is perfectly mated to the 8 gear auto transmission and greats 25% better fuel economy than my old 2008. The fit and finish is excellent and I feel confident this car will be just as reliable and trouble free as the 2008. The navigation is excellent, as is the voice commands. Gets it right 99% of the time. Now the bad news. After 9 years I expected a few more improvements.  The standard sport seats (which I had on my previous car) give great back support but are definitely too firm on the bottom portion of the seat. The blinkers on the side view mirrors are a nice touch, but are distracting at night. The dashboard layout is very familiar, but also a bit dated. For some crazy reason BMW decided to move the cruise control from a stalk behind the steering wheel to buttons on the steering wheel and in the process remove the power button for the radio from the steering wheel. I use the radio everyday. I rarely use the cruise control. The steering is lighter, but I think a bit too light. Brakes are also a bit too soft, compared to my 2008. All in all, a very nice car that I doubt will disappoint many people. I test drove other convertibles and came back to BMW. Choices are few if you want a 4 seater convertible.',\n",

       "  ' I fell in love with the BMW F32 4 series the first time I saw one.  Long sexy lines, low and wide stance, long drop hood and long sloping rear.  The new inline 6 cylinder engine is a major refinement for what is probably the most successful sport sedan/coupe in automotive history.  When you start the car, it gives you a heart pumping exhaust note.  Not obnoxiously throaty, but simply exudes power.  The 8 speed auto transmission is silky smooth as a BMW should be, easily shifts down when power is needed.  Handling is tight and controlled, the low and wide stance coupled with nearly even weight balance front to rear means this car can corner almost anything. You really appreciate the extra torque when you punch it on the highway, no hesitation, just presses you into the back of the seats.  Awesome.  I have owned three BMWs and the technology is finally catching up.  The new iDrive version is intuitive and much quicker than earlier versions.  I actually use the voice commands; they are intuitive and much easier to use than in past.  I particularly like the connected drive app to send destinations from my iPhone to the Nav system in the car so when I get in, my destination is ready to go.  I also like that Pandora and Amazon music are fully integrated to the app so I can stream music directly through the car and dump SiriusXM once the free trial is over. The front sport seats are super comfortable and adjustable, while the back seat is not really usable for adults (short trips only).  It\\'s a 2-door coupe, I didn\\'t buy it for the rear seats.  I\\'m 6\\'-2\" and very comfy in the cockpit.  Ok, for the not so great - for 2017 BMW changed their included maintenance to only 3 yrs 36k miles which means three oil changes.  No more wiper blades, you have to buy a $600 upgrade to get wiper blades in the first 36k and another boat load of cash to extend the maintenance another year.  It\\'s a real downgrade for buyers and makes BMW much less attractive to own.  If you have a 36 month lease, this doesn\\'t affect you.  I have the same complaints as everyone else - run flat tires suck, are expensive to replace and harsh to ride on, the electronic steering is mushy compared to the old days although every car comes with it these days, because the suspension is taught the ride can be harsh especially on crappy Northeastern roads.  It is a great car, pure joy to drive, sexy and powerful.  Definitely worth considering despite the maintenance plan change.',\n",

We opted for the pricy Dynamic handling package so we don\\'t know how it would ride/tow without it but it is smooth as glass on the highways, a bit choppy around town but then again its a BMW and handles like one. The MSRP was $80,000 so there were many other SUVs cheaper that we looked at before buying this pricy one. We are totally satisfied. We did have a vibration issue that took replacing both tires and rims to correct. Many trips to the dealership Gurrrrr. But its fixed now and we are very happy with our purchase. Highly recommend this SUV and especially with the diesel engine and if you can swing the $4,500 option price go for Dynamic Handling too.

It’s not unusual for me to start in first gear, move to 2nd and then shift to 4th then 6th gear. The car comes pretty much fully loaded with only a couple of available options. Compare the loaded MSRP of the M2 to a comparably equipped M235i. They are nearly identical in MSRP. So what do you get in the M2 that you don’t get in the M235i?  You get more power, better brakes, wider tires and better performance. The M2 also comes with a standard limited slip differential which is a $2,700 accessory on the M235i. M2 fuel mileage is about 24 MPG in my daily driving and I get 29 MPG on long highway trips. One thing to note, the suspension is stiff and it is not adjustable like it is on the M235i.

With the upgrade to the 6 cylinder (which is the engine I am use to having), the fun to drive factor and performance is definitely still there.

       "  ' UPDATE ON OWNERSHIP EXPERIENCE AS OF 8/28/2017I have now owned my 2017 BMW 740i for 8 months.  The odometer reads 8,895 miles.  The vehicle actually drives and handles even better than when I first bought the car back in December, 2016.  I am averaging 21 mpg city, 36 mpg highway and 25 mpg combines highway/city.  Remember, this is the inline 6 cylinder turbo delivering 320 hp and 335 lb ft of torque.  The engine is more powerful and responsive that one would expect out of a 6 cylinder configuration - but with the turbo boost, the car accelerates rapidly even at 55 mph.  It seems to have tremendous torque throughout most of the RPM range (1900 rpm - 5500 rpm).  It has taken me many months to master all the technology offered in this vehicle - especially the drive settings (Sport, Comfort, Comfort Plus, EcoPro, and Adaptive.  Most of the time, I keep the car in either EcoPro, as it is the most fuel efficient setting, or in Comfort.  I rarely press the Sport mode as it is the least fuel efficient.  I\\'ve driven from Ft. Lauderdale to just south of Jacksonville, FL and back twice since I\\'ve owned the car.  Most of the driving is at 70-75 mph and the distance is 300 miles each way.  The car rides and handles beautifully.  I especially like the Adaptive Cruise and Self-Steering modes as it makes the drive much more comfortable, not to mention safe.  Another feature I have really enjoyed is the 360 degree camera angles when parking the car.  Here in South Florida, we do not have much in the way of parallel parking - most is just pull-in parking with a parking stoop in the front of the car.  I use the 360 degree cameras so I pull into the parking spaces straight rather than at an angle.  The sound system is magnificent, especially when listening to FM HD music stations or DVD\\'s.  I use Apple Car Play all the time and it streamlines Bluetooth calling, text messages received and readouts of those text messages.I usually buy a new car every year but I have no intention trading this one any time soon.  This one is a keeper!The only problem I have had with the car was with \"inadvertent trunk opening\"!  After bringing it in the dealership twice, they said one sure-fire solution to this anomaly is to reprogram the car\\'s computer so that the trunk cannot be opened with the key fobs unless the car doors are unlocked first.  So we did that and I have no more inadvertent trunk opening problems.  I still can open the trunk without the key fob by moving my foot under the rear bumper or by pressing the trunk release just above the license plate frame.  So this is a minor inconvenience - having to unlock the car before using the trunk release button on the key fob - but it has not affected any other trunk operations.I do not know when I will be in the market for another new car, but I am sure it won\\'t be for a few years and I am sure it will be another BMW 7 series.  For the money, it is the very best large passenger sedan built.  Sure, the Mercedes S Class sedan is a great vehicle, but in my opinion, not worth the $15,000+ more than the 740i with all options.I still recommend that if you buy one of these vehicles, that you make sure you add the Driver\\'s Assistance Package, the Driver\\'s Assistance Plus Package, the Executive Package and the Parking Assistance Package for the 360 degree camera views.  I also recommend the 19\" wheels.  Remember, the car comes with run-flats so you have no jack or spare tire.  If I had to do it all over again, I probably would not get the run-flats if I could and would add 19\" Summer Performance Tires.  I believe it would produce a better ride with better handling.Still the best car I\\'ve ever owner or driven!!!',\n",

       "  \" First, WARRANTY for 2017 and all previous generations is 4 years or 50,000 miles. Maintenance is 3 years or 36,000 miles. The driving safety features like blind spot assist work at any speed, not just over 35 mph. Saab vs. BMW, you got to be kidding me, but I'm not surprised given the extreme loyalty Saab drivers have with their cars. But you cannot compare the two in pretty much every way. BMW's iDrive is way more advanced than any radio/information center ever put into a Saab. Maybe that's the problem, the BMW is too advanced for you. It sounds like some of the issues with the negative reviews were as a result of a poor delivery experience. The issues discussed could have been easily remedied if you had a delivery that showed you how to use the iDrive system. There are so many easy ways to customize the iDrive system and the options to do so are rather endless. If you're not sure how to find something, just ask the voice commands as you can literally ask it to do anything. And the best part with the iDrive system is there no lag with waiting for info to load, like the Mercedes command center. I suggest talking to your BMW service center and arranging for another experience. Oh, and there is no BMW Complaint option in the iDrive. The X3 performs better than the suggested EPA, and I usually 7-10 over the speed limit. The seats are super comfortable, offering good support. And for someone who is interested in keeping as good of posture possible, these seats will do the trick because they are firm and offer many adjustments. The x3 28i will not blow  you away with its power but it is more the sufficient when power is needed, especially for every day driving. Plus, I'm not buying a SAV to drive crazy and super fast, so this engine is perfect. Awesome ways to adjust the 2nd row to put all 3 seats down or any one of the 3 down for added cargo storage. This is the first SUV/SAV my boyfriend will drive because it drives like a sports car and doesn't look sissy.\",\n",

I asked its they were leasable.... not the 2016s but they had a couple 2017 service loaners that were.....  for the same lease price as the less equipped X1!  I took one for a test drive.... so much nicer and more comfortable than the X1.  I changed my mind and leased the X3 right then and there!  It is a comfortable, quiet and really fun to drive SAV.  Plenty of power and good gas milage too.... amazing!  Some long trips coming up and this will make them much more enjoyable.  Just go drive one!  I came off a Ford Escape lease and moved up to the X3.  The price difference really isn't that much for the big step up in comfort, quality and drivability.\",\n",

BMW still has a 4yr/50,000 bumper to bumper warranty but for 2017 the included service or maintenance is only covered for 3/36,000. That is the main reason I wrote this review to clarify that. I have only had the X3 for 3 weeks and only driven it 300miles mainly because I own a Nissan Leaf and the 2 year free charging ends for me at the new year so I drive my leaf whenever I can. I can say that I seem to really love the BMW. I like nice things and new technology  and have had several loaded Kia\\'s in the last 5 years because I got a lot for my money and didn\\'t care what other people thought. My 2015 Sorento SX was loaded and I do miss my remote start already which was not an option on the BMW for all the things you can get. But I will say that everything just feels and sounds better in the BMW. Is it $10,000 better I can\\'t say yet but for me if I am going to pay $550 to $750 to own not lease a car it is worth it imo to love what you are driving. I did love my Optima SX with the 2.0 turbo and it was only $400 per month with 0% interest but sometimes you just need to fit something more than you can in just a rear seat pass thru. I really didn\\'t do much research before I bought it on Black Friday and  got $2500 off msrp and $1000 BMW rebate/cash/credit whatever you want to call it. So for the last 3 weeks I have been watching reviews and reading up and I can say I don\\'t have any buyers remorse. The only thing I am used to is 0% with Kia and my Nissan but I guess 2.9% for 72 is the best BMW usually offers. I wanted the M Sport and a few other options. There were a lot of vehicles to chose from but only a few with the M sport package. I actually went in looking at the X1 because it really isn\\'t that much smaller and the price was less. The 2018 X3 will be all new and probably larger to make it more different from the recently upgraded X1. I am happy to buy at the end of the current models cycle because hopefully all the bugs are worked out. The only X1 they had with the M sport was loaded with 2 packages I didn\\'t want and was the great BMW astral blue but not my first choice. Nearby was the X3 I ended up with for only $4000 more and still over loaded but it had the 20\" M sport staggered wheel package that just makes it look so much better. I checked the price of replacement tires because I don\\'t want to pay $300 or more for a tire but found  great options that are not run flats but will get a spare and take care of that down the road. I drive my cars close to the limit and I ride sport bikes and of course I have not driven the X3 even close to max because it is not even close to being broken in but what I have noticed is that when you push it just a little it seems fine and enjoyable but the next level it I think it will be not quite as enjoyable. Should I have gotten the 3.5i with the adjustable suspension maybe but at close to $56,000 there are a lot of other performance options out there. I think my biggest complaint will be with the 8 speed Auto trans instead of some of the dual clutch auto\\'s available. Manual is not an option for me because of other drivers in my family not to mention I prefer to concentrate more on my lines and braking etc. than shifting. In sport it seems to hold the gear to long and doesn\\'t seem to read your mind and once it does shift its brisk but jerky. Maybe it will get better when it learns my habits but I think it will be in comfort or sport plus where you have to shift up or down yourself when I am alone. I think if the car is problem free I will keep it and add the Dinan computer upgrade dealer installed and doesn\\'t void the warranty that adds over 40hp and 40 ft/lbs of torque at the wheels and get coil over suspension that I can slightly lower the X3 and have adjustable rebound dampening to make an even firmer but not to stiff of a ride. Another thing I like is I see a lot of X3\\'s x1\\'s and X5\\'s but not to many with the M package or the nice rims. Mostly x5\\'s so it looks different from most out there without customizing.',\n",

Even merging, if I floor it, it\\'s so ferocious I let up on the right foot. With the eight speed transmission, manual shifting mode is not something I utilize much. In sport mode, the computer delivers flawless downshifts. I\\'ve owned an X1 35i and 335xi. This SUV is tons faster than either of those very quick cars. Power aside, this car is extremely poised on the road. The ride is the best I\\'ve owned, loads better than my new get Volvo xc90 (without air suspension). Steering is numb but in every day driving, I actually appreciate not having to work to turn the wheel. It is a bit scary accelerating in a corner with such little feedback. The car never wanders on the straights, though. Interior quality is the best I\\'ve owned in the BMW. I did get the extended leather upgrade. My X1 has some cheap plastics on the pillars and doors. Not the X5 50. Everything feels top notch. I\\'ve not had any unwanted noises or noticed anything that doesn\\'t quite fit together right (unlike my volvo xc90). Back seat space is great. I fit my three kids back there just fine. There is more than enough space in the boot, in my opinion. Tech is the sore spot for me. Yes, this car has blind spot and pedestrian detection. The cross traffic detection is just not that handy. You have to be looking at the display for the flashing yellow. There is no audible or tactile feed back so if you are just backing up and not paying attention to the center display, it\\'s pretty useless. Also, really BMW? Not including auto-cruise control at this price point is just stupid. My X5 doesn\\'t have that option. Still, the idrive interface is easy to use. I really appreciate the knob now that my wife has an xc90 where everything is touch. There is touch too which really helps with entering addresses. I think the writing feature on the dial is a gimmick. I never use it. I have the standard harmon kardon sound system. It\\'s just fine. However, my wife has the B&A system on her XC 90 and it does not disappoint. I think it would be worth the extra $$$. Handling is great with xdrive. I live in MN. I put pirelli winter tires on the spare rims I got with the car (mine was optioned with the 21\" M wheels with pirelli p zeros). Compared to my wife\\'s new xc90 with all season tires, there is a definite difference with stopping and starting. Turning is better in the volvo.  The car is more rear wheel biased and xdrive doesn\\'t really help much when turning in snow at least compared to my experiences in other all wheel vehicles. Bottom line: if you are getting an $80,000 plus BMW you probably do care what others think. In the 50i, you know you are going to leave the Q7 and CayenneS drivers in your wake (most cars really). It\\'s very satisfying moving such a large vehicle with such ridiculous acceleration.',\n",

Never have a sense of control issue, the car just does everything you tell it to do and does it extremely well.  Many have commented it is the most beautiful and comfortable car they have been in.  I agree.  Have had it a year and zero issues (same as my 2014).  Quality level, fit and finish is outstanding.  It is quieter than previous 5 Series and I like that.  Very smooth ride and mated to the road.  Big improvements.......audio controls are vastly improved and imputing an address into the Nav system is down right simple.  Display is great, and touch screen easy to use as is IDrive.  Got head up display as part of package and love it although you cannot see it if you wear Polarized Glasses.  Standard sound system is fine (don\\'t bother with over priced up grade).  Self parking is wild.....it works well (but a bit spooky to let go of wheel and let it do it\\'s thing).  Biggest complaint is that Blind spot monitoring is not a standard item on a vehicle of this caliber.  Come only with expensive upgrade package..........this is dumb.  Last negative, forget the Car Play option.  Gets confused if you have a number of Bluetooth items coming off your IPhone (Audible, Spotify, Pandora).  IPhone works better with it off......wasted $300.  Overall on a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.8!!!',\n",

I have all the options I could have had with the Benz but so much more power. The technology is state of the art and user friendly.

It took the BMW factory two weeks to provide a replacement part from Germany. Local BMW dealer paid for a rental car, but I was not happy that it took more than two weeks to return my car. Why did the DSC Module fail after only 12,000 miles? Dealer had no answer. Why did it take two weeks to provide a standard part that should have been readily available at BMW Germany factory and could have been overnight shipped? Dealer and BMW USA rep had no answer.

It's only a 4 cylinder but the twin turbos provide more than adequate acceleration.  No other car that I've had drives quite as nicely as a BMW does.I've had the car for about a year now.

       "  \" I love this car. I live in the midwest so decided to get xDrive, which is only available with the 8 speed ZF automatic. My last 4 BMW's had manual transmissions and rear wheel drive but I wanted a car that handled well in both good and bad weather and one my wife wouldn't complain too loudly about driving occasionally. I can't afford to buy both a weekend fair weather car and a commuter car for year round driving so I bought a car that does both well. The car is a rocket-the xDrive is faster than its' manual or automatic rear drive counterparts and only about .1 second slower to 60 than the M2. I do miss the manual trans. but this ZF is unreal, upshifting and downshifting when it should. I wish BMW would go to a touch screen interface for radio, nav., etc. because the iDrive can be tedious. The car could use a couple more USB ports-there's ONE in the console, that's it. Voice recognition works great for both on board and Siri use with Apple Car Play. The 360 degree distance sensors are excellent and will even warn you of a curb your front or rear end is about to scrape. Haven't tried auto-park yet. The suspension adjusts from firm to firmer, but hey, I didn't buy the car to drive grandma to church. Trunk room is more than adequate and the rear seats fold if more room is needed. Before I bought the BMW I looked at the Camaro SS-like sitting in a tank, no visibility (but that LT1 sounds fantastic!) and the Ford Mustang GT-nice but bland. Both Camaro and Mustang have less rear seat room than the BMW, which has adequate leg room but limited head room (those over 5'5 will be uncomfortable). They also had belt lines so high you couldn't rest your arm on the door. I find myself looking for excuses to drive this car-it reminds me of my first BMW, a '69 2002, but on steroids. In an age when cars are constantly getting bigger and heavier BMW has gone the other direction and created a modern day throwback-thanks, BMW!Update-I now have 12700 miles on the car and love it more than ever. I had a Dinan Elite piggyback ecu mod. installed which raised hp to 414 and torque to 479lb ft and has a warranty that is the same as factory, 4 years/50,000 miles. Wow, talk about making something  great into something special-blindingly fast but still quiet-no drama just seamless speed. The car and I are one, she is an extension of me. I dream, like all car nuts do, of having other cars but the bottom line is that for the money I can't think of a car I'd rather have as a daily driver; it's near perfection.\",\n",
       "  ' This is what a sports car should be.  Fast and nimble with enough creature comforts to make driving a pleasant experience.  The torque is downright scary.  One has to watch the speedometer when driving onto a freeway, or before you know it you are doing 80-90+.   The suspension dampens those little bumps well, yet allows for good road feel.   Cornering is a delight.',\n",

New I drive is much better than previous versions. Only slight negative is the steering, the feel of my old 2009 328 was better. Every thing else is a definite upgrade. I will update later after more time with the vehicle. Now after 3000 plus miles, the car seems better than ever. I am using the sport mode more that causes the car to respond more like my old 2009. The gas mileage is pretty good at 27 combined. The only negative I have found is sometimes the trunk seems to open by itself, I do not know if it has to do with the sensor. It turns out to be the remote. I got a case for the fob and it has corrected the problem. After 8 months, this is the best car I have owned.',\n",

       "  ' I recently purchased a 2017 BMW X1 Xdrive.  I have previously owned (2) 3 series and (1) 5 series.  IMO, the 2017 X1 is the best value for the money of all the other BMW\\'s I have owned.  It is not the best handling or planted to the road BMW I\\'ve owned, actually it is the least.  But, for its class, its absolutely the best handling and value for money.  For this class(small CUV), I actually prefer the front drive platform to give it the best overall use of space.  This little CUV(I consider it a cuv instead of SUV), because its actually more like a slightly raised hatchback or wagon but looks like a SUV.  The 2017 is slightly revised from the complete remodel in 2016.  The 2016 has a standard sport suspension but for 2017 they changed suspensions and made the sport or M suspension available as an option with the M sport package only.  I assumed I would like the 2016 better but after test driving the 2016 and 2017 models, I actually preferred the 2017 suspension better.  IMO, the 2016 is a little harsh and hard. I think the 2016 having a sport suspension and awd the handling is amazing but a little hard for many people interested in a suv. The 2017 has a more comfortable feeling but still offers terrific handling, especially for its class.  I really enjoy the std \"Driving Dynamics control\" with Eco, comfort and sport settings.  In sport it changes the heft and feel of the steering and even though it probably doesn\\'t effect the suspension, some how it does effect the over all feeling of the handling and seems to improve it.  I drive all the time in sport setting.  I have not driven the FWD only model but I am pretty sure the AWD model provides better handling and a more planted feeling.  For those of you that don\\'t want to purchase the M sports package that includes sport suspension, the standard suspension with sport setting and awd still offers great handling in the 2017.  This car zips around and goes into tight spots pretty easy.  Its actually a small car but feels very big inside and that\\'s because of the front wheel drive platform it offers a much better use of space.  The back seats offer plenty room.  The cargo space in back is plenty big and also there is space underneath the floor on the back that provides even more storage. There is also plenty of head room in the X1.  The quality of the plastics are good, typical Teutonic German simple look but a luxury look and feel to dash.  The std front seat probably needs a little more cushion but the standard vinyl seats look good.  If you are looking for a small suv(cuv) I think the BMW x1 is clearly the best in its class.',\n",
       "  ' Love this car, did lot of research and decided to order this car. The reason I ordered the car is because of the color and i wanted the sport package that has the sports seats. I did not like the regular seats at all, and my advise to all is that for 2017 you can order the car with sports seats, i would have not bought this car otherwise. I got this car loaded except for the driver assistance package with is worthless in NYC.  I only have a couple of minor gripes about this gorgeous car. The first one that when i picked up the car at the performance center i found out that the media system does not have a hard drive and my second grype is that the car does not a a space for sunglasses, so I use the cubby hole in the drivers side door. This car looks luxurious and great with the sport package big difference over the regular one. it is worth the extra money for the looks and suspension. One more thing I would love to see this car with a bigger engine and a diesel option.',\n",
       "  \" I had a 2003 Lexus IS300 Sportcross for 13 trouble-free years and despirately wanted to stay with a Toyota product.  Unfortunately Toyota has seen fit to make C pillars so big you can easily hide an Escallade in the blind spot and that's just not okay.  Reluctantly I jumped ship and leased a 2015 328i Wagon.  True to the reviews it was very luxurious and handled well but it was a luxury car... not so much a Sport Wagon.  Thanks to an idiot who couldn't see 4,000 pounds 10 feet away and decided to make her left turn anyway I recently found myself back in the market.  With no viable options to even consider I leased a 2017 330i Sport Wagon.  The specs say it's the same size as the 2015 but it drives like a small car instead of a mid-size and feels like a compact sports sedan.  Steering is much heavier, turbo-lag is non-existent and it just feels right.  Oh yea... and there's a ton of cargo room in the back.\",\n",
       "  ' This is an update of our review from a year and a half ago. This is the best car we\\'ve ever had. We\\'ve been driving our 2017 330i x-drive wagon, with M-Sport package and (importantly) adaptive suspension, for about 13,000 miles.  (Note that the 2017 and \\'18 models are almost identical.) It\\'s a sheer pleasure.  First, the wagon looks gorgeous and is very distinctive -- almost unique --with its Estoril Blue color and Coral Red interior. The 250 hp G-48 engine purrs along with a pleasant sound is very fast and, combined with the 8-speed auto transmission, is consistent over the whole range of speeds.  At 90 mph the car is smooth and rock-steady. The ride is a nice balance between comfortable and firm. The safety tech and version 5.0 infotainment features are state-of-the-art. What really brings it all together from a handling and comfort standpoint is the adaptive suspension, which is a no-brainer at $1000. You won\\'t find another compact wagon nearly this good, and virtually no cross-overs and SUVs -- including BMW;s -- compare with the looks and handling. It\\'s a terrific road trip car as when we toured Nova Scotia.  It is rock-solid, comfortable, agile and \"planted\" with the X-Drive. Also, it\\'s quite rare or even unique in our configuration. You will see very few 330i wagons on the road and almost none in the more rakish-looking M-Sport package.  Why get a BMW crossover that looks like every other crossover on the highway? Remember that every inch of added height in an SUV or cross-over diminishes handling. This car is pretty expensive but worth it.',\n",
       "  ' The car looks, feels and drives very nice.  This is my second 328d!   The first is a 2014 with 30K miles never had issues like both of  my 2014 E250 and 2015 Q7 tdi have been at the dealerships for repairs.',\n",
       "  ' This is my second i3, and the extra battery range is a game-changer. I also got the REX this time, and it really does make this feel like a \"normal\" car for my driving. I love the dark interior woodwork, and I feel like I\\'m driving a spaceship to work every day. I love it!',\n",
       "  ' - SEP 2017.  Wow, I finally picked-up our 2017 i3 REX specially ordered from BMW’s “I” plant in Germany (highly recommend designing and ordering your own, it’s fun and worth the wait).  We chose Fluid Black with Blue Accent exterior and it is beautiful (the only current USA solid color option for the i3).  I thought Fluid Black may blend in with all the other similar size/style cars but it is still very distinctive and like no other car on the road with thanks to BMW’s design and using accent colors like the electric blue.  However, I still miss the Black Sapphire Metallic paint quality.  We also selected the Deka World interior and it matches the exterior colors perfectly (really, it’s above our expectations and we are VERY picky!).  We also selected the 19 inch “428” style rims for the tires and they are awesome!  We couldn’t be happier with the color choices.  We waited to order our i3 so we could have the larger 94ah battery, the i3 moonroof, and the new turbo charger option for home charging.  I fully loaded the i3 with all the options including premium sound (which kicks!), moonroof, parking assist and technology packages.  We immediately tinted the windows and are completely satisfied with the appearance.  The i3 turns heads!  I do wish factory tinted windows were an option, tinters struggle significantly with the i3 windows and a factory product would be much better.  I travel to and from work daily around 50 miles per day so the i3 is ideal.     - Before buying an EV we had to transition our minds to understand the design focus on weight reduction and power use.  We asked ourselves; “how much will miss the big BMW tires, the extremely full feel of and comfortable seats that adjust with a touch of buttons, the Heads-Up Display (HUD), Blind Spot Indicator System (BLIS), etc.”?  You can get allot of GOOD amenities with “todays” fuel powered vehicles and when weight really doesn’t matter.  However, the i3 is so different that it’s an easy transition to make and is so simple to use!  Do we miss those items?  Yes and no.  It’s actually fun to embrace helping earth be just a little less negatively impacted (e.g. meeting the global goal of reducing carbon monoxide).  Please know I researched the i3 for months and watched every on-line review and consumer feedback… well, I’m sure I came close.  I also test drove an i3 and thoroughly researched where BMW is headed in the future.  I feel confident to say that \"today\" BMW is a front leader in EV investments and are just a few years from a dramatic upgrade in overall capacity, which is why I leased over buying (technology is RAPIDLY changing every year).     - I have to admit, I love the way BMW is making information/content of value available in the drivers decision-making domain (dashboard/windshield).  I\\'m a big consumer and believer in hands free information of value on-demand e.g. I want to speak what I want and then see it or receive it in a way that does not interfere with safe driving.  I also want driving to be as effortless as possible.  Power is important but driving in America, unlike other countries like in Europe limits speed and therefore for me amenities matter more (but I still go 0-40 in the i3 in 1.8 seconds; can you imagine how fast it will be in 2020!).  I also want excellent visibility and a brand I can depend on.  BMW service is important to me and is above average compared to others.  The i3’s two floating dashboard displays are easy to see and I am so glad they’re NOT touch screens.  Touch screens distract drivers and the last thing I want is another screen to clean daily.  I plug the i3 in, it charges during low rates for Georgia electric and I’m never out of electric fuel.  I can tell the i3 with my iPhone to cool off, heat up, lock or unlock, fuel during certain hours, etc.  The i3 parks itself and the cruise control is incredible as it automatically keeps the distance between vehicles and adjusts speed based on that vehicles speed in front of you.  We are surprised about the interior storage for running errands and the i3’s rear doors make accessing the rear seats so easy.  I find it hard to be critical of anything so far because BMW did such a good job thinking this design through the “driver/occupant” challenges/wants.  I encourage everyone thinking about an EV to research it and think seriously about a BMW, especially with the federal and other rebates still available (helps reduce cost of ownership).  Overall, we easily give it 5 out of 5 stars but we will see over time.  If the scale was 10, I would say a 9 out of 10.  A 10 for me is extremely hard to achieve…. I wish the i3 was equipped with Heads-Up-Display and BLIS (just to increase safety).  I also wish there was mesh storage on the back of the seats.  And, I can’t help wishing it had run flat tires and a solid metallic paint option.  Other than these personal wants, the i3 is so far, well-above expectations.  GREAT job BMW!  Love the i3!  100% electric fun!',\n",
       "  \" This car has exceeded all my expectations.  It's the 2017 Rex Terra world.  Most of my driving is highway and oh what fun it is.  Looks small from outside, especially from the rear, but inside you feel you are in a spacious car of the future.  The handling and comfort are most surprising for an electric car and even more surprising is the acceleration and control you have.  Some things about the car take a little time getting used to, such as the regenerative breaking.  But after a few days, it becomes so natural you soon realize this should be in all cars.  The back seats fit only two adults but in the two times in the eight months I have owned the car, I have had someone in the rear seats only twice and they were quite comfortable.  I'm glad I got the Rex which provides a generator to charge the batteries as you drive to go an additional 80 to 90 miles.  That's more than an hour of driving until you find a gas station.  I've only been to the gas station a few times.  Most drivers would not even need the Rex but it does help with the Range Anxiety.  The maintenance on this car is just about none.  I drive 80 miles to work and back each day.  I have enjoyed the quiet comfortable ride every day.  My average speed is 75 mph on the highway and I look forward to driving every day.  It's just so much fun...\",\n",
       "  \" The 2017 X1 S is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I bought it to replace my 2015 Ford Escape which itself is a great compact SUV. I saw a 2015 X1 and thought I'd give it a look. My impression was cheaply made, way too small, and WAY overpriced. I ended up replacing my 2013 Ford Escape with a 2015 Ford Escape (long story, but I got a killer deal on the car and the trade-in and 0% financing so it made financial sense). We recently ordered my wife a 2017 Mini Countryman S version (a fantastic car btw) and during my research found the new Countryman was based on the NEW X1, so I gave it a look. I am so glad I did. A totally different car from the previous version. Plenty of interior room, nice materials, great ride, and for the first time in my life, a great value on a BMW. I don't like the feel of the sport seats--they just are very uncomfortable for me. But the standard seats are surprisingly comfortable, which ultimately sold me on the car.  I love the ability to use the eco mode when driving on the longer stretches of road. I have been getting 32 mpg on my normal commute. And when I shift to the sport mode, there is plenty of fun power when I want it. Its not a sedan or coupe, its a compact SUV, but it is fun to drive. A few little complaints, like the fact that the cup holders hold maybe a sippee cup and  there is no digital speedometer or compass on the base model, the Bluetooth seems to lag a little when using Waze or Google maps, and the A/C seems to want to run even when I turn it off.  But all-in-all a great car.\",\n",

Installed a 220 v 40 amp charger in the garage that is very convenient.  Haven\\'t had to use the Range extender yet, though my wife told me she got a notification that the engine was cycling, presumably just to keep the fluids from settling too much.  Enormous headroom; I\\'m 6\\'4 and have another 2\" beyond the top of my head.  Visibility is excellent.  The rear seats are quite usable but wouldn\\'t buy it if we anticipated using them a lot.  Lots of trunk space.  Only gripe is that the BMW technology integration is a bit wonky and takes some getting used to.  Would have loved to have electric seats, but I suspect that would have added significant weight.  Carbon fiber body is really nice as is the interior wood.  Seats are very comfortable.',\n",

No range anxiety with this especially with the new battery.  I've driven over 100 miles and still had 37% percent battery charge left.  The new color option of protonic blue is a great step forward.  Pick-up 0 to 30 is outstanding though you will feel the road and bumps a little much.  Previous reviews on ride comfort hold true for the battery refreshed 2017.  Overall a great car for suburbanites and urban dwellers.  Getting 5 miles per kW hour.\",\n",

The front seats are very comfortable and cabin is VERY quiet. Steering is nice and tight, my previous X3 was not.

Yes, I've read the reviews of not alot of cargo space compared to the X3 and reduced visibility because of the way the rear end is sloped but so far neither of those items are concerns for me.  Cargo area is fine for grocery & mall shopping; it's not like I'm purchasing a 50 flat screen tv everyday.  Rear visibility is good; just use your mirrors.  But I did add the Driver Assist Plus package which gives me a bit more confidence in driving.  BMW's X-drive is very nice as it controls power to all 4 wheels and keeps the vehicle stable and in control during rain, snow, and icy conditions.  Overall I'm very happy with my lease and when it's time to make another choice, I'll be hard pressed to go back to a sedan or get another X4.\",\n",

Cons: The controls and instrumentation are awful. The gear shift is very un-intuitive and you cannot go easily from manual shift mode back to automatic without going into neutral. The back-up camera comes on in reverse (duh), but it does not turn off until you roll forward for a while in a forward gear; this is distracting and unlike all the other cars I have driven. The paddle shifters are worse; it's very easy to hit them accidentally, at which point you *have* to shift via them; there is no easy way to go back into full automatic mode... you just wait until GM decides it's the right time to return to auto mode. The engine turns off when you come to a stop... sometimes... others it doesn't. The headlight controls are hidden by your left hand if you drive using 9-3 or 10-2 hand position. The touchscreen must be used for climate control and it's arcane and opaque in terms of getting the air set just right. The audio system controls on the touchscreen were such that I just turned the volume to zero to avoid having to deal with it (why no just turn it off? you ask... well, when I tried that, it turned off the whole touch screen along with the climate control). Overall, the user interface with this car is what I would expect from sophomore level design students who did not have enough time to complete their semester project. If it were simply a matter of getting used to different controls I would be more forgiving, but the controls o this car are just plain bad and would be a nagging irritation for as long as it's owned. Also, the gas tank is small and I had to hit the pumps more often than I expected. Not recommended at all.\",\n",

       "  ' I had turned in my 2015 Impala and was looking for another sedan. I had driven the Chrysler 300 and the Lexus ES 350. My local Buick dealer let me take the Lacrosse  for the weekend to give it a thorough test drive. While the car has many positive attributes, there are few major issues that kept me from buying it. First the good: The engine and transmission are a dream and provide smooth, quick, fuel efficient operation. The engine has strong exceleration and utilizes cylinder deactivation on the highway. I  achieved an incredible 31 mpg highway which is very good for this size of car. The 8 speed transmission is the best I have ever driven and unlike other 8 speeds, it doesn\\'t hunt back and forth for the right gear. It shifts so imperceptibly, there were many times I had no idea what gear I was in. Very Nice! Lastly, you can order Adaptive Cruise with an 18\", 19\" or 20\" tire so you can get a comfortable, bump absorbing tire without having to be pushed into a package of options that includes hard riding 20\" tires. Now the bad: I don\\'t know who they are designing these front seats for but I\\'m a small guy, 175 lbs and the seat was too narrow for my legs and thighs. I\\'ve seen this in Cadillacs as well. Hello GM! Side seat bolsters are for THIGH SUPPORT, not to SIT ON or increase pressure on driver/front passenger legs! The bucket seat width narrows towards the seat back so much that my uppers legs were sitting directly ON the side bolsters. After 20 miles, the backs of my upper legs were hurting from the pressure.  This absolutely killed the car for me which is too bad. The seat cushion itself was pretty comfy but the side bolsters were unbearable and my salesman said he had heard the same complaint from other potential customers as well. The next issue was overall quality with the car having a \"cheap feel\" to it. The rear, fold down seat back  would not latch and lock  in the upright position. The exposed, stationary latch mechanism attached to the back trunk wall (with grease all over it)  was locked in the closed position so it couldn\\'t engage with the seat back. I looked at it for several minutes trying to figure it out but could not get it to release. Looking into the trunk from the rear I saw polyester white foam stuffed in behind the trunk wall and the seat back that was coming loose and falling out. I have no idea where this foam was supposed to go or what it\\'s purpose was.  The morning I was supposed to return it, the battery died and I had to charge it. Then an error light came on referring to  a transmission problem. This car had only 700 miles on it and cost $43,000 +,  you just shouldn\\'t have these kinds of problems!  My 15\\' Impala was perfect and trouble free for the duration of my 24 month lease. It\\'s seats were wide, supportive and comfortable. The car was quiet, and had great build quality and materials. I wish I could take this advanced engine and transmission and put it in the 2017 model I ended up purchasing. The bad thing about the Impala (again, Hello GM!) is I got pushed into a 20\" tire to get my adaptive cruise which I will  be quickly trading out for more comfortable riding 18\" tires. The 20\" tires transmit every road imperfection and make for a very hard, uncomfortable ride. I know, they look very cool but to me, it\\'s not worth the sacrifice in comfort.  I\\'ve researched how the adaptive cruise works and talked to my engineering friends in the auto industry  and contrary to popular belief, you can change tire sizes without any problems.',\n",

And the seat back lacks sufficient lumbar support even when the power control is set for maximum support.  Powertrain is smooth and quiet.  Air conditioner cold and powerful.  Gearshift control is unconventional and unintuitive - took me 5 minute to figure out how to shift into reverse.  Ironically, I find several much less expensive full sized cars have more comfortable front seats than the Buick Lacrosse, Toyota Avalon and Lincoln Continental; e.g. the 2018 Toyota Camry and 2017 on up Kia Optima.  As a potential buyer seeking ride and seat comfort, at present my favorite prospect so far is the 2018 Camry LE or XLE as it offers near LaCrosse levels of ride comfort and quietness with much softer, more better shaped seats and superb directional stability on the highway - all important characteristics for fatigue free long distance cruising.',\n",

But, when turning or straight acceleration on an incline, there is a noticeable shake/shudder while in 1st gear.  The harder the acceleration,  the more severe the shake.  I've even paid to have my local tire store check the tires and balance.  This should not be in a vehicle of this class and price point.  I hope Buick identifies the source of this issue and gets a fix in dealers hands, and proactively notifies owners, before more reviews make note of this apparent defect.  Once you are moving, the Envision's ride and handling is exceptional, quiet and smooth.  For such a soft ride, it is very responsive and does not have cornering body roll.   I love the interior design and materials,  but would prefer slightly softer seats.  The safety features are nice.  I personally do not like the Lane Departure feature and have turned it off.  You find yourself constantly fighting the steering wheel.  The stop/start feature is ok.  But, it should have a couple second delay.  When making parking maneuvers, the engine cuts off on you ... this should have been thought out a bit better.  Overall, it is a nice vehicle at a reasonable price point, but has a few quirks that you should think about.UPDATE:  I sold the vehicle after 3 months.

On the road the Lacrosse is very quiet and comfortable with plenty of power when you need it.  I was impressed with the overall mileage on the first fill up at 29.4 mpg with a 200 mile trip to PA and the rest mixed driving.  Some things I found troubling was there was no sunglass holder in the overhead (can use the space under the shifter, but still...), the visibility is not as good as I would have liked out the front when making turns and parking, and the transmission hunts a bit at low speed going up twisty hills (can shift into manual to smooth out).

There were a only a couple complaints about the car 1) needs more side bolstering in the driver's seat to hold you in better 2) typical GM needs to upgrade their sound system, it was ok but needs much deeper sounds 3) also typical GM needs to work on electronics, the automatic climate control kept turning the fan speed up and down to keep the car cooled where as my Toyota and Lincoln can do it without blasting the fans to maintain the set temp. Just small complaints to an other wise great road trip car.\",\n",

Go ahead and spend $60-$90K for a sportier machine, I\\'ll enjoy my ride for half the cost.',\n",
       "  \" Electronics, nav, etc controlled mostly with touch screen. I'd like to have more functions controlled on the steering wheel.  Rear cargo area will not fit golf clubs transversely.  Integration with phones, IOS and Android is excellent, but everything must be controlled via the touchscreen, and this requires taking ones eyes off the road, not too  much different than texting.  The control pad on the right side of the steering wheel controls information screens on the center of the dash, such as gas mileage, next oil change etc.  All of these could be controlled by another means, and the control pad on the steering wheel used to control functions on the touchscreen.  I believe this is a serious flaw in design, and is as dangerous as texting while driving.\",\n",

       "  ' This car surprised me in a few ways:  It gets better gas mileage than our Impala did, it is more comfortable, and a little quieter sometimes.  There are three issues worth noting: (1) There is a noise in the driver seat when turning,  (2) The manual shift option has caused a problem, but that is because the way I have always driven my cars - with my right hand on the steering wheel, my fingers  accidently have touched the paddle shifter, and that causes the engine to race and the car slows down.  I have to brake to a stop, and then re-start in order to clear it.  I need to learn how the paddle system works, and keep my hands of that section of the steering wheel.  The third issue is noise on uneven pavement.  Frankly, I expected the car to be much quieter in the cabin.  On smooth roads, this car is almost silent,  Gas mileage on latest tank, around town, was 22.41 mpg.  Back seat room on this car is enormous, and the seats, front and back are very comfortable.  The car handles very well, for not being a hot rod or sports car.  Special likes: Blind spot warning system, digital odometer, back up camera,  and GPS which works very well.  OnStar is really nice and it gives me monthly electronic reports on our car.  Overall, very good except for the things mentioned, but they are minor and we will learn.  One last thing: My wife is partially disabled and she is able to get in and out of the car fairly easily.',\n",

Instead, the computer keeps track of where cylinders are to restart. The car restarted once while I was stopped at a light because the air need to come back on, it did surprise me. However, under normal driving you don't even know that there is start-stop working. The engine is running after you take your foot off of the brake and before you can get to the gas. It does not turn off until the speedometer reads 0. The adaptive cruise uses about one car length per 10 MPH on the closest setting, I wish it had a closer setting for highway driving.\",\n",

Among the great things:  Ride, smoothness of operation, seat comfort, Auto stop/start, gas mileage - 35 mpg on highway trips, 21-22 around town mileage, 24.2 overall probably 90% around town, easy to use technology, sound system, new style gear shifter, trunk size, quiet operation.  Our friends that have ridden in this car are blown away.  Before buying this car I test drove: Toyota Avalon, Chevy Impala, Lincoln MKZ, and Nissan Maxima.  None of these compared to the comfort, handling, styling, and overall perceived quality of the  2017 Buick Lacrosse.  To put things in perspective, this is the 12th new Buick we have purchased since 1966, and have only had one that was not terrific.  However, this is head and shoulders above all of the previous 11.  Buick hit a home run with this design.\",\n",

I have had no mechanical or technological issues with the vehicle since purchase in November '17.\",\n",

The Bose audio capabilities are splendid, especially on long trips.  Heated seats and steering wheel are welcome in the cooler weather.  Will enjoy the cooling seats in summer’s heat and humidity.  Love the expansive  sun/moon roof.  Passengers can enjoy so many vistas as they are chauffeured here and there. All in all, the LaCrosse compares very favorably to the Cadillac XTS, but is kinder to one’s bank account.',\n",
       "  ' I got a surprise upgrade from the rental car company - \"Buick LaCrosse Essence\" with 4k miles on the odo. I rented it for a day and travelled 500 miles. This is firmly the best car I have rented so far. I hesitated to accept the upgrade in the beginning because it had a 3.6 V6 engine and would eat up my pocket. Luckily NO! I was surprised by the fuel efficiency. 528 miles and I have just filled close to 16 gallons of fuel. For a full size car with a big engine and beasty acceleration, I did not expect this much milage. 10+ hours of drive without much of tiredness. It is a very silent car. Cruising at 70mpg, not a noise. You will doubt if the engine is actually running. It has a very rich interior and awesome driver\\'s seat that feels very comfortable for long rides. The dashboard is ergonomically designed with most of the buttons in reach. However, the seating is too low and will sink you down such that you won\\'t see much beyond the dashboard for city rides. Maybe it was because I am a short person (169cm). Otherwise, the car felt very very stable and smooth throughout the ride.',\n",

       "  \" I really like this little SUV / Crossover.  The dealer has let us use this vehicle while our car has been in the shop for the last 1.5 weeks and I'll be a bit sad to let it go.  I looks great on the outside and inside and I can fit my 6ft 3in 215lbs 50 year old frame into the very comfortable, heated, leather, drivers seat just fine with plenty of head room.  It's easy to get out of too and the roomy rear seat area is similar.  Our vehicle comes with heated rear seats and rear HVAC controls.  The interior is nicely equipped with faux wood highlights and panels, the dash knobs and buttons and the instrument cluster gauges seem to be well placed and the infotainment system works great other than sometimes it automatically connects to my iphone and other times it asks to connect.  This might be because the SUV is in demonstration mode... at least this is what the SUV tells me whenever I start it up.  I also like the auto open/close rear hatch.  I can adjust it so it only opens 3/4 or fully.  With it set at 3/4 I can open it in my garage.  It drives very nicely and comfortably and I have good visibility other than the front window posts are a bit thick which looks nice but sometimes can hide an approaching car.  The vehicle is punchy and takes off well when I hit the throttle hard but it obviously doesn't have the 300hp my sedan has.  It brakes well and holds a line well while accelerating, cruising and braking.  It also has the auto start feature.  It's kind of weird coming to a stop at a stop light and feeling the engine stop.  It starts right up quickly so really no complaints there, I just wish it would wait a bit longer before shutting down.  Overall, I really really like this SUV.  It's comfortable, handles nicely, has plenty of comfort features, quiet and seems well made.  That being said, there's only 5k miles on it and I've only had it for a week and a half.\",\n",

It has so many options I'm having a blast learning them all. It is by far the quietest, best riding, and best driving car I have ever owned. And I think it is the most stylish car on the market, not gaudy but sophisticated in its looks and styling. I tested a number of competitive models from Lexus, Kia, Hyundai, Nissan and Lincoln and they just didn't compare to this car. If you love to drive a luxurious, quiet yet great handling car, with plenty of power I highly recommend you take a look at the Lacrosse!Update 1/17/18 - this is truly the best car I have ever owned. Can hardly believe the mileage I get. I drove to my mothers home and back and, while I admit to taking it easy, averaged over 38 mpg for a 200 mile trip! Unreal! Loving the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist features as they make the car a pleasure to drive.  The adaptive cruise control is a real stress reducer, especially in heavy traffic. Just set it and let the car do the work. Buick has really done an outstanding job with this car.\",\n",

I got a great deal on the Lacrosse since they were running a Memorial Day special with a 16% discount. I built the car I wanted on Edmonds.com at noon and had three offers that were much less than I expected by the end of the day, the lowest of which was from Wilkins Buick in Glen Burnie, MD. The dealer was able to find the exact car I wanted and had it ready for me to pick up in just a couple of days.  I love the interior and exterior styling and the extensive technological features which were very intuitive to learn.',\n",
       "  ' This car at first I started to say no to. Then once I drove it was so quiet and nice and the acceleration for a 4 cylinder was amazing compared to the Equinox that I was driving before. My only complaint is the storage between the seats. When someone is with me there is no where to put my purse, or my dog who likes to sit on the console.  Getting in and out at first was a change for me from a SUV. But if you put the seat in the highest upward position it helps a lot. The trunk is amazing, more room than my suv by far. I would of liked to have the beeping on back up along with the camera, which I had before letting me know I am getting too close.  But it gets great gas mileage compared to my 4 cylinder SUV. I average around 26 MPG, with the Equinox I got 21. The leather is nice on the seats, it has a clothed material around the edge to keep the seats from cracking from ware like transitional leather seats. And the inside trim is accented with a nice chrome color.  The Touch screen is wonderful also.  I have about 7,800 miles on mine so far, acceleration still wonderful on it. Also the AC is nice and cold. I have a White Regal with Black Interior, the AC cools it pretty quickly as July has been a hot month. Also, this car is not for Middle Class and Retirees only.  The Regal 11 Sport has power. My teenage daughter Bought a Jeep Cherokee and loves to drive my Regal due to the acceleration and Sun Roof in mine.',\n",
       "  \" Overall I absolutely love this car. I will say that even though the car is FWD, the front sits really low. I'm constantly worried about taller curbs when parking. You have to watch your head getting in the car (I'm 5'6) because the headroom is low and the seats sit low. If you raise the seat to drive, there is a chance of bumping your head upon getting out the vehicle. Thanks for the built in rear view camera because due to the shape of the rear window and the incline of the rear end, that camera is well needed. I was a little upset about the lack of a CD player. But I guess if you can learn to use the electronic trans. shifter, then you can learn how to use USB cords and the Bluetooth to play music from your phone. I absolutely love the engine and all the bells and whistles including the all the pretty moon-light ambient lighting throughout the vehicle when park/headlights are activated.\",\n",

       "  ' \"I own the redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse, Premium/AWD. Previously I drove the 2010 LaCrosse, purchased new and redesigned that year. My satisfaction with the previous generation was outstanding, delivering exceptional service and reaching nearly 80K miles at trade-in. The NEW generation LaCrosse for 2017 undoubtedly sets a higher benchmark for Domestic Luxury Sedans! In addition to its superior comfort and quietness while in motion, this model simply excels in technology and efficiency. Loaded with every safety feature imaginable, this Buick also includes the most advanced 3.6l VVT 310hp V-6 engine, that includes Auto Cylinder-Deactivation and Auto Start-Stop technology. These features collectively assure impressive gas mileage without compromising on rapid acceleration. The latest available, 8-speed auto transmission, is operated by a very intuitive, shift-by-wire control knob. Gear transitions are flawless at speed. Being completely fair & honest with such low mileage currently, I choose not to rate my experience in reliability. However, if this model meets or exceeds my experience with the 2010 Buick LaCrosse, I will surely give it a 10/10 as well. I have no doubts on the future of this car. Every Professional review that Ive researched, suggests that this Buick will indeed give most comparable Foreign Luxury Sedans a serious run for their money! \"Update: My mileage is now just over 4K; I\\'ve experienced zero issues with performance and zero warranty claims. This vehicle remains such a pleasure to drive, both on local trips as well as long distances. It is so comfortable and quiet. The rear seat has proven itself to be very roomy and as comfortable for adult passengers. I am approaching the Winter season here in Wisconsin and will be anxious to assess the performance of the AWD system. UPDATE 2/28/18: We have are approaching the 3K milage and have been through a typical Wisconsin winter. I am very pleased to confirm that the AWD system performed flawlessly and provided sure-footed traction during the wet/snow/ice conditions that we\\'ve since encountered.

Very little vibration, quiet, smooth ride for a midsize suv. Handling and braking is great! We leased the Premium 1 with the Turbo. Very lineal torque curve, not a lot of down shifting on the highway. Smooth 6 speed, and no engine noise except when you accelerate. Interior fit and finish is excellent. Highway mileage was 26 mpg on our first highway trip. If the start stop feature bothers you, just shift it into \"L\" and click it to 6. It will cancel out the stop start feature.

Some road noise at highway speeds but the short wheelbase is to blame for that i believe. Only downside is storage capacity is somewhat lacking. But we have just one kid and it is not an issue for us. The rear seats fold down flat which is nice for additional storage. You can fold down either side or both leaving half of seating available for the kids car seat. Also the front passenger seat folds down flat for additional storage for those longer items you may transport from Ikea etc, All in all very happy with this vehicle and got it for a great price during GM's 25% off msrp sale.

       "  ' UPDATED:  After 10K miles and 9 months of ownership, I have only a couple of negatives.  Price, without rebates, is excessive.  No passenger armrest is unforgivable.  Cargo area is a bit tight and I wish it had a bit more room for things.  Everything else is good or great, mostly great.  Front seats have helped with my neuropathy by supporting the back of my legs.  Car holds road at well over speed limit, handles great, and is like when I owned my Mini Countryman - like driving a go-kart.  Shifts great.  Enough power.  No complaints.  Everything has worked as it should and provides a good value when you consider rebates.  I would recommend this car to everyone and anyone.....most don\\'t realize it, but this is one amazing car and will fit the bill for many even if they don\\'t know it yet.  Headlights with fog lights on are simply amazing.  I\\'ve never owned a car I have enjoyed so much and am so glad to have.  Quiet ride.  Great radio.  Too many goods to mention.  We purchased this about a week ago.  We\\'ve logged over 500 miles and while it is a good car in lots of ways, some basic things seem to have eluded the engineers at Buick.  Note, this is made in South Korea, not in the USA as would be assumed if it has the Buick name.  The biggest complaint I have to start out with is the lack of a passenger armrest, and the almost completely useless one attached to the driver\\'s seat.  Come on, really, no center arm rest?  We didn\\'t realize it during our short test drive, but it is very annoying.  Two adults sitting side by side in the front, are sucking up each other\\'s oxygen.  The cabin feels cramped.  And that you could deal with if there were a stupid center armrest.  Many things about this car are great - gas mileage is about 27 mpg with mixed driving, and a quiet ride and decent handling of bumps.  Steering is easy and accurate, and easy to get into a parking spot.  The A/C and heat work well.  The car has a decent feel about it, not cheesy or junky.  It is smaller than other SUV\\'s, and I\\'d say over priced for the size and functionality of this car.  BUT, we needed a less expensive car and still wanted an SUV, with AWD.  This, coupled with the 16% off from GM, it turned out to be the answer for us to downsize our car payments.  For the pricepoint of $25K after discounts, you get an SUV, with AWD, and a host of features that you could not get on other SUV\\'s.  So, it fits the bill.  Awesome LED daytime lights, which double as parking lights and turn signals, LED tail lights and brake lights, which is really amazing.  Plus, fog lights.  Auto on/off lights.  Navigation.  Carplay (although it is buggy).  Side blind spot monitors in the mirrors.  Upgraded cool 18\" wheels with nice tires.  A real spare (mini spare, but not a can of flat fix).  And the car is overall a good value for the money, compared to the SUV I have for my use.  Without the 16% back,  I would not have bought this as it would have been out of my price expectations.  It isn\\'t perfect, but for what it is, and what it cost, I\\'d say it is a decent value.  You have more leg room up front than you\\'ll need.  This helps the back seat passengers, who could not fit unless the seats are slid forward.  The cargo area is small, but the rear seats do fold down and that opens up alot of space.  This fit our plan to shrink our car payments and provides a decent value with the 16% off sale.',\n",

       "  ' I bought his Cadillac XT5 thinking I could give business to native company. I was debating between this and Lexus RX. Made a big mistake buying it. I traded my wonderful Toyota Seinna as it has done 70,000 miles ( It drove and was more reliable than this Cadillac XT5). The SUV was good for about a month then problem after problem.1) The Central touch screen went dead within a few weeks of owing the vehicle and it took almost 10 days for them to fix it as it has to come from the company. When I got my vehicle back after 2 weeks, found that they removed the dash and was not fixed properly as the dash close to the passenger side was misaligned and the under dash led light was also not fixed properly and I have to fix it myself as I don\\'t want my vehicle to sit at the dealer for another week.2) I went out of Country for 2 weeks and when I came back found that the SUV will not start and called roadside assistance, they came and jump started the SUV with a Jump starter ( are you guys kidding me, its a brand new SUV that has done only 1000 miles) -  it took a week for them to fix it.3) Rattling sound coming from rear seat - which I fixed myself after buying some insulation material from Lowes.4) \"Crispy sound\" coming from electrical box located below the left side of driver side dash. The fine crispy sound comes every time I accelerate from 0-30 miles and then disappears - took the SUV to the dealer - they said that everything sounds good ( they don\\'t want to acknowledge)5) After the battery issue was fixed, I started seeing that the voltage of the battery started falling again after a week coming back from the dealer - per dealer, the rear brake light was constantly lighting up ( the company had a recall for this as per the dealer).6) My car has made multiple visits to the dealership in 6 months of owning it - Horrible reliability.Went against Consumer reports rating about reliability and purchased this vehicle and I got burned. Don\\'t waste your money. I ended up selling this vehicle after owning it only for 6 months.',\n",
       "  ' First, let me say I bought this XT5 with all the hopes I was buying a quality vehicle....a Cadillac! I had done my homework and researched it thoroughly. Except for one key area I will explain later. To the point, From day one, I had issues that should have sent up red flags.  On to the important stuff. Once I got the car and drove it for a week, I noticed a rough riding, quirky gas hog that had all kinds of electrical gremlins. The ride is harder than my F-150 pickup! No lie? That short\" break in period \" promised never came about. Gas mileage is aweful. 16 mpg around town with the small engine and 19 on the highway, with a very conservative driver. And only FWD. On to the Gremlins. It started when it wouldn\\'t go into reverse. It\\'s an electronic shifter, not like your conventional cars. On one occasion, it took 15 tries to get it into reverse. Shifting of the 8 speed transmission is sloppy and felt like it\\'s slipping. I was told by the dealer\" It\\'s the normal way it shifts\" . Really? The lift gate would just stop working. Wouldn\\'t work with remote, inside button or outside  switch. The Bose stereo would go flat like my 1960 transistor radio.  Then pop back into this century at any given time. Overall, the quality of the radio was poor anyway. Not up to Bose standard. And the car has unusually loud noise from wind and tires. It is actually distracting to drive for long distances. After about 2,000 miles, a loud clunk could be heard coming from the transmission. Another issue looked at by the dealer but \"could not duplicate.\" I could go on and on but I\\'ll wrap it up. Wipers come on for no reason and don\\'t come on when they are suppose to in auto mode. Poor  tracking, seems to chart it\\'s own course going down the road. A recall later and several trips to the dealer has cured nothing. My final word, I looked up Cadillac and found they are 2nd to the worst for \"lemon law \" complaints. Should have done a little more research. Could have saved a bundle of money.',\n",

Paint actually started coming off all four wheels.  In shop now as all wheels have to be repainted.  Horrible ride.  My F150 rides better.  And who actually thought the auto stop was a good idea?  You really should have driven this thing for a month before you marketed it to the rest of us.  In a loaner again.  So mad at myself for thinking GM could produce a quality product.

Those are the problems that have been resolved. What has not been resolved is the headliner makes a loud rattling noise. It comes from the area between the sun roofs. I have taken it to two dealerships and they have attempted to fix it with “clamps”. That actually made it worse. Last but not least. The car makes a very loud whining noise. It sounds like a cat being tortured( not that I have heard a cat being tortured). It’s really loud. I understand that I may have just gotten a lemon but so far GM has not done anything to make this right. It’s a great looking car but so far miserable to drive.',\n",
       "  ' This is a 2017 Cadillac Escalade ESV buyback. We knew they put a new motor in it. We bought it 14 hours away from home. Then stopped 9 hours away from home for dinner. It would not start back up just click, click , click. Had it towed to the nearest Cadillac dealer, stayed in a hotel, got a rental . Called Cadillac customer service and since we had AAA tow it they refused to help me with anything. ( Hello, I JUST purchased the vehicle a few hours previous.) Went back over to the dealership in the morning with the rental after getting uber to take us to the nearest rental place open on a sunday hoping it would start and it did. Took the rental back, drove straight home did not shut it off at all. Once home we shut it off , then tried to start it again and it would not start just click, click, click. Had it towed to a dealership near us. It would not, not start for them (4 days). I went up and got it. I had e-mailed Cadillac Customer service 3 times by now with no response. I called Cadillac customer service got a case# and was told to e-mail my receipts of being stranded in Toledo Ohio, so I put the receipts in the next e-mail for reimbursement.   Afraid to shut it off wherever we went,  two weeks later it acted up again. no start, just click, click, click. My guys bumped the bottom of the starter and it started so WE knew it was the starter and the dealership confirmed that 20 miles after the motor was put in they put in a starter ( not told to us when we bought the vehicle) . Back up to the dealership it went. For a week this time. I e-mailed Cadillac customer service again asking for the status of my case# and to advise them the vehicle would still not start intermittently . Still no response from Cadillac customer service.  Still it would not, not start for them. I went back up to pick it up. Now today June 19 2018 exactly a month from the day we bought it . It will not start just  click click, click. I know if we put it on the tow truck to go back it will jostle the starter and it will start again for them. I called the dealership and they can not send someone to my house. So, I am again stuck with a vehicle I do not dare drive anywhere without leaving it running. Cadillac Customer Service is a Joke. I have a case# and yet still nothing has been done. I have e-mailed them 5 times called 9 times and the only contact I have had from them is from me making the effort to contact them. I have received 1 phone call from them on June 16th(Saturday I was with my children and do not answer my phone) and it was on my voice mail that if I did not contact them by June 18th they were closing the case.    I called them and got NO ONE, only a voice mail and I left a message. Still no call back. So I called another # this morning and they transferred me to the same \"Senior Rep\" for me to leave another voice mail. I received a call on my cell phone which I had told them only to use after 5pm. She \"Sheila\" the senior customer rep stated they denied my reimbursement and told me to have the dealership near me reimburse me. Then they possibly would reimburse the dealership. WHAT it is not the dealership I am taking it to to be fixed fault that the vehicle stranded me 9 hours from home 5 hours after I bought it . I told her it is not the money, I have the money to cover the hotel, uber, rental,  it is the principal that Cadillac is suppose to be the ELITE of customer service !!   I asked to have her supr call me. She said it will be 1-2 business days. Then preceeded to tell me that they consider business days as 8 hours a day and it would be before 48 \"business\" hours that I would receive a call.    So, maybe 5-6 days before I get a call and in the meantime I am stuck with a Cadillac I can not depend on !!!!!  BEYOND FRUSTRATED !!!!!',\n",

Good points are that it is very quiet and is a pleasure to drive on the highway.  Overall, this car is a major step backwards from SRX.',\n",
       "  ' I was not sure about this SUV initially. Did some research before buying. I never owned a Cadillac before and has always owned a Lexus. I was planning to buy a new Van/SUV for my wife as her Toyota Sienna has done 68000 miles on it. Even though the Sienna is a great van, I did not like the fact that AWD has the Run Flat Tires on them, which gives it a bumpy ride and is expensive replacing the tires as it cannot be repaired otherwise it was a great family vehicle for us. My son has been learning to drive and it was also did not look good for him as he was driving a family van. Since my Sienna was well maintained, I good a good appraisal for it, so we decided to buy new car. Initially we saw Pacifica, which my wife did not like - quality of the vehicle was in question. Then we took a test drive in Cadillac xt5, Very good ride, excellent quality overall. People talk about the Cue not being fast enough, I think the Cue is much better than the system in my 2014 MB ML350. I also noted that the xt5 does not have a CD player - which i don\\'t mind as we never use CDs anymore, as we have learned to use USBs/SD cards. The vehicle has 2 USB port in the front console and 2 for the back seats, I would have expected Cadillac to have SD card reader installed - but not a big deal. The other issue is the cargo space, it could have been little bit bigger, the head clearance for back seat is 2 inches short when compared to Lexus RX - hope Cadillac brings an SUV with little bit more space for the back passengers and cargo. There is no other choice, either you go for xt5, or Escalade which is huge. Over all very happy. Have to wait and see how it holds up to its reputation.         The above was my earlier review. Currently my SUV is with the dealer with complete black out of CUE system. Why driving the CUE system completely went dead and an error message saying \" waiting for update media\" and \"copying 0/100\" appeared. I absolutely have no control on navigation, blue tooth etc. The service guy does not know what it means and said their technical guy in off. Its been 4 days and no answer yet. Ended up going to Cadillac owners forum and found out other XT5 owners having same problem and the fis is ti install\" human interface module\" and have to wait for that part to arrive. So frustrated that a SUV that is done 1400 miles and 3 weeks old in service station? what kind of quality they have in their car? I miss my Toyota van and made a blunder buying XT5 instead of Lexus RX350. No more Cadillac.UPDATE: - SOLD IT AT A LOSS',\n",

My previous vehicles operationed beautifully and I was often very happy with the driving exprience.  Given my good luck with GM, I decided to jump into the XT5 (FWD Premium Luxury Package).  The styling is terrific and the car is comfortble.  However, the instrument cluster is a recycled dash of the previous SRX but with illumination that is way too dim for day light driving.  The result is a dull, lackluster display not befitting a luxury flagship vehicle.  The Auto/Stop function is downright annoying and possibly even dangerous in heavy stop and go traffic.  With the vehicle shutting off / stalling all the time it gives the driver a very uneasy feeling when you need sudden acceleration, such as in making sudden turn in an intersection.  GM HAS to disable and or allow the driver to opt out of this feature.  Now, with only two weeks of owning my XT5, the entire Cue system has gone haywire and is blacking out and turning on and off at will.  Buyers remorse is an understatement. This flagship line of GM has been struggling for better market share and without a little more thought, time and real world testing, the XT5 and Cadillac for that matter will find itself lagging behind the completion and may fail all together.   Seek out other vehicle options or stick with the SRX until GM sorts out the bugs and design issues.\",\n",

This is a total of four failures in 7 months (including the one that came with the car). The 'patch' solution is to place the transmitter in a cradle at the bottom of the center console (a solution I discovered in the owner's manual when on a dirt road in AZ, late on a freezing cold afternoon by myself) when the car would not turn on.  However, in the case of car not turning off, the doors won't lock if the transmitter is out of the cradle.  So when out of the car, the car has to remain unlocked.  I'm a travel writer covering 5 states.  This means my car has been left unlocked in hotel parking lots many a night.

       "  \" This is a second shot at a review after 2000 miles and a fairly long trip of all day driving. First of all. The acceleration is wonderful. The handing is not Lazy boy Cadillac, it's sporty handling corners like a sporty SUV which I guess it is from the performance. Love the handling. Love the silence on the road. I have residual hearing problems from big guns in the military and even with my dodgy hearing I can easily hear my music and audio books on trips, not to mention the helpful musings of my spouse. Braking is excellent if not a tad touchy. You do not have to stomp on these brakes. I love the safety features like lane change warnings, rear crossing warnings and the back up camera although I have never got the need for the digital track in the rear camera to bend its my turning. I know I'm turning. I am very gratified that an American company is making a car of this apparent quality. It gives nothing to the off shore imports. This car is a stand out in a city where you can't swing a dead possum without hitting a BMW and Mercedes. It seems to be some kind of cultural imperative but I've had my share of complements even though I doubt many people look carefully enough to distinguish it from a SRX. The overall appearance of the exterior and mechanicals is stunning and the color I selected, Silver Coast is a stealth car wash avoidance feature. It hides the dirt wonderfully when I am negligent on washing the car.  one last small gripe. I don't like the design of the 18 inch wheels. Kind of seventies looking. Cadillac could do better. Look on the web to get some ideas. My single annoyance with this part of the car and it is a BIG one, is the inability to turn off the stop/start mechanism. You can off foot it and you get lurches. It is not as clever as the propeller hat engineers who designed it think it is. I hate it and would not buy the car again. I can find just about any other car that allows you to disable this dubious feature including other Cadillac models. It works off the brake and you can fool it. If you are at a signal and the engine turns off, just lift your foot off the brake and it will start again. Depressing the brake again while you are waiting will not shut it off a second time. I am not thrilled with the XT two step.  I want to get this all praise out because I think this is a Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hide car. Mr Hide designed the interior. The dash lights adjust automatically and are too dim in day light for me. I can not manually adjust them higher. They brighten in a parking structure and at night and you can dim them down with the dimmer switch but that switch does nothing to brighten the dash lights in the day. This forces me to use the window with a large numeral for speed determination. This is a problem because of the propensity for the dash to reflect overhead sun at certain times of the day. In fact, same said genius engineer also probably designed the center information center with insufficient shading and helpfully tilted the screen toward to windshield at the top just to make sure that you don't miss getting the screen compromised by the sun reflection.  You can play CSI and count your finger prints on it for lack of seeing other information. The seat is my biggest interior problem. My wife's RX350 has wonderful seats. She is looking for a new car and ruled out the XT5 because of the hard seats and the uncomfortable lumbar support. I have the same complaint. Hard seating not good for long drives. bothers my leg. I had to get a piece of memory foam which my spouse sewed up in a cover to put on the seat. This is a sport seat and not suitable for a SUV in my opinion. All the SUVs I have ridden in and owned have had more comfortable seats. Again. Live with this car before you buy. Rent one and see if the seat suits your back side. I hate them which makes it awkward for a car I now own.  As I said, I am tall and large. When I sit with the seat back, it is obvious they thought to put in a long seat track for tall people but then failed to accommodate any other interior feature to this seating position. The center console is difficult if not nearly impossible to get into. The dash information center is way too far away. The door panels bow out near the front of the car then conveniently bow back in to crowd your arm. Another thing that escapes me is the logic of the seat memory. In any other car you press the memory button and number one for example to set your seat and in the future you just tap the button to make the seat move. In the XT, you have to lean on the button for the entire trip and if you stop pressing, the seat stops moving. To have the seat work automatically you have to turn on a feature in settings. After you do that the car resists any further changes. You have to turn it off to reset memory. In my case that is far too frequently because the seat does not seem to hold the back rest angle and must be readjusted periodically. Brilliant outside, not inside.\",\n",
       "  \" Buyer beware. First off, don't get your Cadillac from Arnie Buaer. Initially, the service was great and then I stepped in the car to drive away with the salesperson and it was not what I initially sat it. It had no heated seats and it had miles on it and I initially sat in a new car ( I had heated seats in my Terrain that I traded in). So anyway, get the car home and weeks later, I'm hearing a weird noice and it's the brakes. I shouldn't hear anything on a brand new car let alone a Cadillac that I'm paying and arm and a leg to have. I've had the car in the shop several time regarding the brakes. In car with my daughter, the car wouldn't let me drive it, it was so bad. Turn's out it was a chip that was related to the brakes after me bringing the car in multiple times, the finally get that squared away. So the last brake incident in July , my oil and tire rotation was supposed to be done, so I would not have to see these 🤡 for. Long time as I feel like I'm there all of the time (for a 2018 Cadillac). I get an email that I need an oil change and then my car indicate that on the display. I call the dealership and said I thought you changed my oil and the lady said that the computer said yeah it says right here that you're not due til March. I said well, my sucker says December of this year. So she says come in so we can take the light out. How bout actually doing the oil change. I'm so disgusted as I bought a Terrain t this same dealership. I can't even enjoy the car, as I've had so many issues. Never again!!! I could've spent the money on a BMW and dealt with less nonsense.\",\n",
       "  \" First of all, I love the way the XT5 drives. It has a smooth, but sporty feel. The seats are comfortable for me.  The back seat is OK but not super roomy.  The cargo area isn't bad either.  I can put a lot of groceries in the cargo area.  The moving bar that is in the cargo area tends to rattle a little bit and it's annoying.  I absolutely hate that the stop/start feature cannot be turned off.  The sound system is medium.  And the infotainment is easy to use and convenient. The gear shift is annoying when shifting into reverse.  Sometimes it takes a couple or three tries.  The interior is pretty and I love the various pages for the dash.  Android Auto works well and helps to keep my eyes on the road.  The large sunroof is great and I love that I can cover it on sunny days.  I've owned the car for about 8 months without any mechanical issues yet.  My gripe is the gas mileage is horrible.  It's supposed to get 19 mpg in the city but I'm only getting 11-12 while driving around town.  The freeway MPG isn't bad (20 plus).  I work out of my home and most of my trips are fairly short.  My Toyota Sequoia got better gas mileage around town.  The poor MPG might be a deal breaker for me.  I purchased a small SUV to get better gas mileage.  This car is thirsty.\",\n",
       "  \" THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE SUNROOF. While driving with my sunroof completely open, for some reason it does something to your ears. it feels as if pressure is in your ears. somewhat like flying on an airplane. I thought it was me, but I allowed three friends to drive the car, and they experienced the same feeling. The only way to eliminate the problem is to open a side window. That defeats the purpose of using the sunroof.  It's a great looking car, but I wish I had chose something else.\",\n",
       "  ' I\\'ve owned my 2017 XT5 (Luxury trim) for 5 months now.  The annoyances outweigh the pleasures.  The auto shut off feature is super annoying.  I thought I would get used to it but...NO.  For example, when I stop for coffee in the morning at the drive through,   my car stops and restarts constantly - when I order, pay, etc. Every time you stop at a light, stop sign,  on and on.  Passengers constantly question what is wrong with it.  I have read on a couple of blogs that this feature stopped working for a couple of customers after time and I pray that this happens with my vehicle.      I have started putting the car in Park every time I stop, but this is annoying in and of itself.  There is a  LOUD  bell that sounds every time you hit the park button and I am advised this cannot be disabled as it is a safety feature.  Apparently someone who has been driving for over 40 years doesn\\'t know how to tell when they have put their car in park.  You can disable the VERY LOUD parking assist system but this has to be done each time you start the car.  There is also a rattle in the back passenger seat that we have yet to isolate.  In short, I was expecting nothing but pure pleasure driving  this \"luxury\" vehicle but spend most of my time while driving it  thinking about how frustrated  I am that I can\\'t \"fix\" these issues.',\n",

We are older folks and have never enjoyed the Cadillac bucket seats. We had a 2013 DTS and those seats did not fit our needs very well. We had to purchase kitchen chair pads from Walmart to get us out of the hole we were in with the vehicle. When we got our 2017 XT5 we thought maybe the seats might be better, nope the same old seats. A friend suggested we visit a Relax The Back store and look at one of their seat units. We did and bought one for our new car. We drove the car from Minn. to Arizona and found the new seat worked just great. When we arrived in Arizona we went right out to a store and bought another unit for the rider seat. This is the first SUV we have ever owned, we have to say we enjoy it very much. It's so much easier to get in and out of this style vehicle.

I contacted the service dept. at the dealer about 2 weeks ago and the service adviser didn't even seem to know that the XT5 had a no-turn- off start/stop system so he told me to just keep driving. I then called the salesman who told me to drive the car until the weather cooled down to see if it would turn off on its own. Today I visited the dealer's service department to make sure that I was not injuring the cat since it does seem to try to turn off at the same intersections that it used to. Today's service adviser printed off reasons that the system does not work and they are the same reasons that I saw long ago on the internet or in the manual. He told me to just drive the car normally and that I would get a warning from the car if something was wrong.  He also assured me that there are many XT5's out here and that none has reported a start/stop problem, although he did not bother to check my car.\",\n",

       "  \" After test driving a few of the 2017 CT6 models, I have concluded this is not the perfect car for me at this time.  First of all, like many high end luxury vehicles, this car is air tight.  Therefore, when all the windows are up, it is difficult to get the doors to close without slamming them.  That's the reason why many of it's competitors went with automatic soft closures for the doors, like the trunk.  Next, a rear wheel drive is not available with the 3.6L engine.  Though I live in the snow belt next to one of the Great Lakes, I have never found the need for AWD as long as I use the right winter tires.  I love the way rear wheel handles.  I will never own FWD again, but would do an AWD as long as primary power comes from the rear.  And, I won't be sold on a turbo charged 4 cylinder engine forced to work hard to act like a 6 or an 8.  Besides, now you are stuck using premium fuel.  Next, I dislike steering wheel paddle shifter's and want to do my manual shifting on the stick in the center console.  And, I was hoping to be able to select something other than black for the dashboard and trim without having to move into the Platinum model.  What with the rear camera mirror?  It actually made me nauseous looking at it.  Otherwise, it is a very good looking vehicle and would most likely own one if it at least had the door closures.  I'm not going to slam doors on my vehicles.  I liked many of the features like heads up display, start/stop technology and brake hold.  With just a few more changes, I can see me behind a wheel of a CT6.\",\n",
       "  ' My last Cadillac was a 2007 DTS luxury with the magnetic suspension . My new 2017 CT6 has the magnetic ride as well but with very little rubber between the road and the pretty 20\" wheels you feel the bumps like never before. I kept the 2007 for a few weeks and can\\'t believe how much difference in the smoothness of the ride the 2007 has over the new 2017 and have to believe these low profile tires with large wheels must make up the difference. As for warranty, I am pretty upset that you do not cover these wheels since they come with the upgrade package. I have a strong feeling the first large chuckhole I encounter will damage the tire and wheel. NOT GOOD BUISNESS for such a great expensive vehicle. By the way, this is my 5th Caddy. I love everything else about it, but I always bought for the smooth ride and this may lose my confidence.',\n",
       "  ' The ATS-V made my short list after exhaustively examining the car and talking extensively with the Cadillac product people at the LA and San Diego auto shows the last two years.  I like what I\\'ve read in all the reviews.  Last Friday Cadillac invited people who had indicated a previous interest in the brand to a driving/instructional event at Qualcomm stadium in San Diego.  After learning more about the features of the models and driving several cars under controlled conditions the ATS-V is now firmly at the top of my list for another car in 2018.  Corvette, Porsche 718 Cayman, and Audi TTS are now tied for second.  In an orchestrated but still pedal-to-the-floor straight line acceleration run to about 80 mph 464 HP, and then Brembo brakes, just took my breath away.  The 8-speed auto (in sport mode) snaps off shifts easily as well as a Porsche PDK.  I drove a regular ATS in a short mini autocross, too, and liked how that model performed.  I\\'ve read the criticism of the instrument cluster.  That\\'s just going to be personal for everyone; it doesn\\'t bother me.  Supposedly Cadillac is working on a better CUE for 2018.  The ATS-V is a real sleeper compared to the Corvette as it\\'s arguably nearly the same car.  The back seat, however, is something that everyone will agree on.  It\\'s uninhabitable for anyone over about 12 years old.  I\\'m only  5\\'11\" and there\\'s no way to fit back there.  Fortunately, there\\'s only my wife and me so I don\\'t require a 4-seat car anyway.  But if you do, please heed my warning.  I\\'ve been doing 4 track days a year with my current car for a number of years now with AudiClub SoCal.  If my checkbook does indeed jump out of my pocket in 2018 I think this Cadillac ATS-V will acquit itself admirably at Buttonwillow, Spring Mountain, and Willow Springs.  See you there.',\n",

       "  ' We waited to get the XT5 because of review promises that the CUE system would be greatly improved.  After 12,000 miles, I would say CUE is still crap.   A huge problem is that the touch screen requires far too many submenus to achieve even simple commands.  The navigation system relies on out-dated maps which reflected incorrect speeds easily half the time on our 40 state trip.  It got lost about once every thousand miles on interstate segments that had been changed at least 2 years earlier.  It had no detour option and will not reroute even after driving 50 miles on a different highway! Traffic warnings were unreliable.  Fortunately if you have a mobile phone supporting Android Auto (AA), that functions like you would expect a luxury car nav system to function.  AA understands my Bulgarian spouses accent every time.  When driving, handling is fantastic.  This car and turn inside many sedans with a far shorter radius than our SRX.  Pickup is quite peppy.  Mileage is very good for a car of this class.  The gearshift is counter intuitive, and the transmission sometime hunts for the right gear in stop-n-go traffic.  The fit and finish is good, cargo space excellent, and it has lots of nice feature like ample door storage.',\n",

They have replaced the drive shaft three times, and the whine is beginning to start again.  Since this the third time they have been unable to fix the problem, GM said to replace the  vehicle.  It also falls into the lemon law.  I hope we can get them to give us a 2018 CT6.  By the way, GM says this vehicle is only the third one in the entire CT6 fleet to have this problem.

I\\'m good with a vibrating seat or flashing light or even a chime or buzzer.  I don\\'t like that the vehicle will actually attempt to slightly maneuver the steering wheel in the direction it thinks the car needs to go.  While it makes the correct decision most of the time, there are driving situations where it does not.  In those instances, I have to \"fight\" the steering to override the decision and often end up over-correcting.

The CUE system has been upgraded in 2017 and is fast as a phone or tablet so all of their disparaging comments about it are no longer valid for this year model and subsequent. Some reviewers complain that when they touch the silver trim on the center console nothing happens. It isn't designed to. You have to touch the lighted controls. They should just figure it out and get over it. Some reviewers complain about no volume knob. I typically use the steering wheel controls so that isn't an issue for me. They don't have knobs on their phones and they seem to cope. Very comfortable seats (I don't have the Recaros), very high quality interior, great performance, very high tech in the Premium Luxury model. Great looking car inside and out. I can't think of a single option they could add to this car (well maybe massaging front seats). I bought a 2017 certified pre-owned with 6300 miles on it (Manufacturers Vehicle) and got a 6 year 100,000 mile warranty instead of the standard 4 year 50,000 mile warranty plus the balance of free oil changes for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles from original in service date for $20,000 under new MSRP. I would never buy new (never have). If you buy this car I don't think you will regret it. I guess my only negative comment on it would be they should sell it with all season tires instead of summer tires. I drove this car plus an ATS V and a CTS V and for the money I think this is the best value for the all around package. You only spend a small amount of time having fun with the acceleration compared to hours cruising down the highway. I would rather lean toward the additional comfort (and better looks IMO) of the CTS over the ATS and paying an additional $20-30K for an extra 200 horsepower in the CTS V wasn't worth it to me.

There are improvements I would make for future editions such as fog lights, mirror turn signals automatic parking display when entering a parking space instead of only after reverse, less menus inside of menus by having more buttons, some materials are sensitive and delicate such as the dash velour so you have to be careful, I don't think the tires have rim protectors on these vehicles, add color changeable ambient lighting inside, night vision option for animal pedestrian detection which is available on some of their other vehicles.

The CUE system is much more user friendly than the systems in the BMW and Mercedes to me. Neither of them have a touch screen. Using a mouse/touchpad and trying to maneuver it while keeping your eyes on the road is not user friendly as far as I am concerned. There is a bit of a learning curve, but certainly nothing like the other systems.',\n",
       "  ' I took my SRX in for warranty work and was given the XT5 AWD as a loaner for one day.  Here is my thoughts based on the 55 miles I put on it. The XT5 is similar to my 4-month-old SRX in terms of pricing and trim level. However, the XT5 is very different in the following ways. Engine: newer engine with auto-start-stop function and a newer transmission.  Secondly, I noticed right away that the led lights are standard and the headlights are not halogen like the similar trim SRX. The XT5 does have the auto start/stop where the engine could be automatically turned off at a red light (by the software). When you step on the gas pedal, the engines turns back on. The car, also, switches between V6 and V4 mode depending on the power needs, similar to Honda\\'s VCM technology. The ride is quiet, smooth, and sure-footed. However, I did feel that the SRX\\'s engine delivers quick power when demanded while the XT5\\'s engine has to figure out how much power the driver needs before delivering it.  So there is a brief lag time since the software has to decide between different modes (V6 vs V4) to deliver power. On the positive note, the XT5 is very fuel efficient compared to the SRX. The nagging windspeed noise originating from the panoramic roof on the SRX seems to have been resolved. The placement of several buttons on the SRX, such as parking brake or Onstar, have been moved around. So there will be a learning curve for the SRX drivers when they upgrade to the XT5. Most importantly, several \"digital\" buttons on the SRX\\'s CUE (ex. such as heated seat button) have been replaced with actual buttons on the newer model. The CUE seems to be more responsive on this upgraded model but there is still a decent amount of time needed to learn it if you are not familiar with the system. The most important difference is the new, redesigned seats.  They are more comfortable than the SRX\\'s seats. My XT5 did come with collision warning, cross traffic alerts, and the seats do have a vibrate function to alert the driver of imminent dangers on the road. Finally, XT5 has a bigger interior and seems less heavy while driving when compared to the SRX. Overall, it is a decent improvement over the SRX. In other notes: if you have a larger family or require more space than the XT5 but cannot afford to break the bank trying to purchase an Escalade, my recommendation is to hold off till the XT7 comes out in 2018-19 timeframe.',\n",

       "  ' After driving foreign SUVS for over 20 years (mostly German), this time I decided  to try something different. I wanted more room, larger towing capacity, 4WD/AWD, and a nicer interior. After 2000 miles in an ESV 4WD Luxury, a new surprise emerges everyday. It has a beautiful interior, nice fit and finish, tons of electronic safety features and the oft-criticized CUE infotainment system. I am pleased and surprised with the ride quality of the suspension and 22\" wheels.  The sophisticated electronically controlled shock technology may be the reason. I have not found the CUE system overly complicated. There is a lot to learn here, but most of the controls seem logical and useful, if you are patient and read the owner\\'s manual.  The interior\\'s low noise level is impressive as is the standard Bose designed sound system.  A big surprise is the weight of this vehicle of this vehicle compared to its European competitors, ie., the M-B GL series and the large Range Rover. They all weigh in the 5700-6000 lb. range.  Cadillac has used a lot of aluminum and lightweight high strength steel based on my research. I like the ability to run less expensive regular or mid-grade gas, (which is acceptable) although premium is recommended. Mileage so far has been slightly less than the EPA estimates.  So far I have only towed my 6000 lb. boat for about 200 miles. The torque and H.P of this model\\'s drive train seemed unfazed with the task. And the room in the rear cargo area is huge. This is a large vehicle, but it doesn\\'t feel that way from the driver\\'s seat or in its handling prowess. It also has a very tight turning radius. So what is there to not like? Keeping in mind the concept of this vehicle and the reason I bought it, I haven\\'t found much to dislike yet, but I\\'ll keep looking. Most owners that I have talked to, love their vehicles and without hesitation would buy another one.  Enough said!',\n",

She is patient, wonderful and knowledgeable no pressure what so ever. The car was really great. The Lincoln was very good.  Unsure how the reliability will be which is always an issue with American brands but we are going to lease. Also waiting for crash test information as well.  We will consider this vehicle for sure expect to purchase within a few weeksOther vehicles driven/looked at BMW X5/3, Audi Q5, Highlander, Kia Sorrento, Murano. I realize some of these vehicles are not considered \"luxury\" but looked at them anyway. Criteria is a top safety pick or better and average or better reliability. Unsure if XT5 will meet safety whenever it is tested. hoping it will last for 3 LEASE YEARS. If anyone has any experience or thoughts please feel free. I called corporate Cadillac they are unsure if and when they vehicle will be tested. If I was them I would be making sure it gets tested.',\n",
       "  \" I wrote the below review about nine months ago when I bought the XT5.   I have definitetly changed my rating on this supposedly luxury SUV.   At 2000 miles, the rear spoiler blew off the car on the freeway, nobody hit but real quality, made the American way.   The best news:   at 6,000 miles , the engine BLEW one whole bank of pistons.   Completely new engine took 5 weeks to get in and installed.   I won't go any further other than the fact that if you buy one of these Caddys, expect nothing but headaches.   I recently bought a new 2018 Audi SQ5 and I am now ecstatic I did.   Audi has hit it again with another winner.  So far, this vehicle  outperforms and handles 100% better than anything Caddy XT5 has to offer for only 1 grand more.OLD REVIEW BELOW:Picked up my new XT5 this past Saturday after doing much research and test driving.   I was not even aware this model was being released by GM this early.   Glad I stopped and looked, drove it and got hooked.In the past 3 weeks, tested QX5, RX350, BMW X5, GLE and GLS.I'm very picky when it comes to attention to detail so I tested and looked at many vehicles.   This XT5 is simply amazing for the value and the money compared to some of  the Germans and Japanese brands.  I have been leary about American cars ever since the bailout but tried them out again.  Glad I did...  Without rambling, and after driving all those other vehicles, Caddy was the winner , hands down.    Handling , front, side and rear view amazing, quietness, power, etc were all as good as it gets in my opinion.  I am not a brand loyal person as you can see but I would recommend anyone looking in this category to give the XT5 a good look.My ONLY picky complaint in the piano black entertainment system panel.   It is a fingerprint magnet.   Told you I was picky.   If anyone has anyone particular questions , you can always ask.I will be really anxious to see what the National Crash Tests look like once tested.   So far, I am thrilled with my decision\",\n",

The ride is better, Cadillac has always had that baby buggy ride much softer than the Lincoln. XT5 electric power is the best very smooth with a short turning radius. Possibly one of the best new feathers is the new eight speed automatic transmissionSmooth as glass, at eighty miles per hour tach is reading 1950 RPM about 200 less than the Lincoln MKX.

       "  ' I was on the hunt for a crossover/SUV that could serve as my work commute car (about 15 miles) with some business meetings an hour or two away while also serving as a family vehicle for travel in New England (and therefore purchased the AWD model).  I love that the vehicle is a V6 with \"cylinder reduction\"; only using all six when needed.  The AWD feature is controlled by a button and can be engaged while driving -- therefore, I do not need to use it in dry/warm conditions.  The interior is beyond gorgeous and comfortable.  Handling is seamless and sporty.  Love, love, the vehicle - so far, so good!  The XT5 is made in Spring Hill, TN - another selling point for me as I was looking for an American car.  Last, but certainly not least, the car takes \"regular\" grade gas.  A huge selling point for me.',\n",

These people are checking with one another to see what the consensus while be. Disregard them. We have purchased a range rover and the Escalade is a nicer vehicle in many regards. The solid rear axle is advantageous for the high tow rating. While the RR has better off road capabilities and is a wonderful vehicle, the Escalade has other attributes to stack up to any large SUV. Cadillac has done a wonderful job with this vehicle. We purchased it over the competition for the third row seat and the retractable running boards. These running boards are far far better than any fixed running board. So, forget the \"professional\" reviews, try it, you will like it.',\n",

I now own an XT5 and it is a great car. Transmission is 8 speed so it's moving through gears nicely. Blue tooth hookup and what I like is if the phone rings, the A/C gets quieter automatically. I like that there are now more buttons and less of that touch screen. I hated pushing the screen to increase the A/C. Now it's a button. The rear view camera can be used as your rear view mirror so if there are people in the back seat, your view will not be blocked. I'm 6 foot but not overweight so I find the seats very comfortable.

There is an excuse about having to change the braking system to add it but it seems like this was more of a cost saving option (on a 40k+ car).It only has resistive cabin heating.  The good news is that it warms up fast, you get heat sooner than most gas engine cars. The bad news is that it can come close to cutting the range in half in cold weather. It’s fine for me since my commute is only about 10 miles but you need to factor that plus aging of the battery into your commute range.It does not have a navigation system option but It has Android auto and CarPlay both of which work OK for navigation.  I kind of prefer this as there are no map updates to deal with.  Also, this is a city car so it will mostly be driven in areas with cell coverage.Some interior design decisions were poor.  The center touch screen can be partly obscured and difficult to reach for smaller drivers.  A lot of space on the center console was wasted for the ‘shift lever’ which is a rather pointless item in an electric car.  It seems like it could have been placed better or replace by buttons or some such.  It even has an odd redundancy of having a shift to park button on a lever that can also be shifted to park.  The cup holders are too close together as a result of using up space for the shifter.  The cargo storage is in three ‘layers’ making it clumsy to get to the lower deck items.  The car also does not come with or offer a spare tire which wouldn’t be so bad if OnStar would actually pick up when you have a problem.  It didn’t work well for me.The Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning,  Following Distance Indicator, and Front Pedestrian Braking features appear to be pointless.  Lane keep assist does no adaptive steering or bump you back toward the lane, it just shows an icon on the screen if it thinks you are out of your lane which is the case almost everywhere (our road markings in town are bad).  The following distance indicator show the number of seconds to the car in front of you but only when you are already too close at highway speeds.  The pedestrian braking feature just shows an icon of a person when it sees someone on the side of the road.  It didn’t see one that walked right out in front of the card.  It also fails to actually brake.The sad part is that mine died after only 2200 miles and the dealer has been unable to diagnose the problem in close to a month.   Apparently trouble logging and technical support are just not up to the task on this car yet.  Maybe this will be a viable car in the future but for now I would avoid at all cost.

It is also loud inside, you really hear a lot of road noise. Another issue, for some reason when I would make a call the ac blower would turn off. I am not sure if there is some issue with the computer or if there is some feature for that. If it was a feature, I would have turned it off but the touch screen is so over designed and complicated I could not find that setting. I drive a lot, especially on curvy, two lane roads and this car was not designed for that. I understand this car is a FWD car but a Ford Focus is way more fun to drive around corners and feels somewhat sporty. Although, the BIGGEST design flaw in this car is the start/stop engine. While most car manufacturers have a on/off button by the ignition button Chevy makes you have to put the shifter in L then press the + button six times. This is every time you put the car in drive! Disclaimer: The Wi-Fi feature that Chevy brags about is you must be near a home or business with Wi-Fi to connect.

Leased it brand new in June of 2017, have put 16k miles on the clock since then ( writing this review Nov 2017) and have had it in the shop 3 times since purchase. Issues include: 1. Transmission slam shifting on the downshift: New solenoids/control module housing replaced at 7k miles and told problem was resolved. 2. Transmission slam shifting on the downshift: Threw codes for Barometric Pressure Sensor, mass air flow sensor and air intake temperature sensor at 9k miles; all sensors replaced and told that problem was resolved. 3. Transmission slam shifting on the downshift: Front and rear universal joints fractured and throwing grease; universal joints replaced, new transmission map uploaded by dealership and told that the problem was resolved. The vehicle still slams shifts on the downshift (usually 2nd and 1st gears) in city driving/any stop and go traffic conditions. The more research that I have done has brought to light the fact that this is in no way an isolated issue with the transmission (6L80E), yet somehow GM cannot figure out to properly fix it. To put the icing on the cake, the frame is not painted but just sprayed with a tacky coat of remediation spray that can be wiped off with no effort, revealing bare steel (this was done accidentally when I wiped oil off one of the frame crossmembers while changing it). The suspension is so soft the truck will literally hop down the road when encountering any tips, or look like a low-rider hopping with air bags God forbid you are off-road. On the same note, the stock Dunlop tires cannot hold the road in wet conditions and offer very little handling performance. The cab vibrates on long hauls at highway speeds to the point where the center seat console literally shakes. The seats are beyond uncomfortable, for long periods of time, and this is speaking from trips to Texas, Wisconsin and Tennessee within 4 months time from South-Eastern PA. The only real positives of the truck include the gas mileage and the 4x4 system which honestly are the only two things that have really impressed me.

The 2017 I have today has by far the worst SEAT I have ever had in a pickup. Tremendous back pain when driving.  I have three cushions in it and still take Tylenol and Advil to make it through a day.   How do I know it is the seat?  Asked a sales rep who the company he works for has chevys.  Said they all have back trouble.  Riding with a Sales Rep in his F250 Ford Lariat all day long no problem.  Riding in Wifes 2006 Toyota Sequoia no problem.  Driving neighbors 2006 Honda Accord, no problem.  I drive 4000+ miles per month.  I would not buy a chevy pickup until a major change is made in the seats.',\n",

       "  ' I used to own a Gen1 Volt which I loved and now I love my i3,  but I want the range of the Bolt and the better drive and infotainment.  Really want to buy this car after my lease is up in my BMW i3.   I love the what Chevy has pulled off with most of this car.  Better acceleration and ride than the i3. But the number one with a bullet deal killer is the seats!  What did you do GM?  I am 6\\'3\" and 225 pounds.  So I\\'m big and a bit wider than a skinny type person,  but I know there are a lot more people in the U.S. wider and heavier than me.  And this is by far the most uncomfortable seat I have ever been in .   First off the seat is to narrow so the side bolsters push in noticeably on your sides in not a good way.  And the seat cushion has a decent amount of \"give\" to it which I like better than the BMW seats which are a bit to firm.  But the bottom of the seat cushion is so thin to the frame that I can just about feel the frame and if that foam breaks down a bit or god forbid I gain 10 pounds,  I\\'ll be hitting it.   Who the \"f\" designed and approved this seat!!!  Someone in China who is 5\\'6\" and 125 pounds???  I would expect this from a korean or japanese car but my 2016 japanese built mazda CX5 has nice deep and wide seats.  And comparably, the BMW i3 has nice wide seats with very minimal side bolstering.  At first I thought they were to \"flat\" but let me tell you they are quite comformatble.   So did Chevy try to save money with a cheap crap seat or was it to make something super thin and light to save weight?  I\\'d rather loose 10 miles of range and have a comfortable seat no question.  Also the use of almost all hard plastics on the interior really looks cheap and bad.  Really some soft plastics will not only look better but make the car even quieter.  Again if this is a \"weight reduction\" issue it was a bad call.  Comfort and looks go a long way in selling a $43,000 loaded car.  Add an upgraded interior if you must but make it look nicer.  Also the low speed braking needs to be a bit stronger for one foot driving like the bmw which is the perfect amount...  and NO I don\\'t want to use the little steering wheel buttons and my fingers every time I want to bring the car to a stop.  One foot driving in the city is a miracle and once you get the hang of it you can\\'t go back to a standard drive car,  so make it perfect.  Also I have no way of testing this but I hope the brake lights come on when you do use regen braking with the car in low.  My old volt did not do this but the BMW does.   Also this car needs adaptive cruise control that goes down to low speed or to a stop and then starts moving again like the BMW and many other cars now have.  Even other GM cars have this so I don\\'t know why Chevy didnt go all the way with this option since they are charging more.  Hopefully this will appear in next years model.   This car could have been a \"10\" and a home run if just these two items were done correctly.  I pray that GM reads these things as I am not the only one to complain about the seats.   I do hope that for the 2018 model they quickly improve these and then when my lease is up I will get one for sure.  Everything else about the car I loved.   But the seats are truly a deal killer for me.  Please, GM!  Fix this.',\n",

The car stopped in the middle of the right two lanesof the freeway on a very busy Friday morning and I was left in a very UNSAFE and DANGEROUS situation when I could not even leave my car and walk over to the shoulder because of the heavy traffic around me. This car cannot be safely used by families with children.I have asked for a replacement of the whole vehicle but both the dealer (Momentum Chevrolet of San Jose, CA) and GM have been giving me the run-around where there is mis-communication or poor communication between the representatives from the dealer and the GM about this very grave problem.',\n",

The headlight switch and the 4 wheel drive switch on the Colorado are poorly positioned, and I have found that my legs move these switches when getting in or out of the vehicle.(No telling how long I drove around in 4-wheel drive when I didn't need it.) Also, I can't see these switches when driving. The throttle response combined with the shifting of the 8 speed transmission provide a feeling of hesitation. The back doors must be slammed hard to get the door ajar light off. The ride on the highway is car-like and smooth. I paid extra to get the Cajun Red Tintcoat exterior color, and really like the way it looks. I have only put about 750 miles on this truck, and would trade it for a new Pro4x if I could afford it.

First year had no issue, then the fuel pump failed at 45k.  This is very premature, but the worst part about it was that it took 8 weeks for my dealership to get the fuel pump from GM.  After getting the car back with new fuel pump, the weather had changed to warm, and I used the A/C for the first time that year, and no cold air.  Took it back it, and the evaporator had to be replaced.  Unfortunately, it was deja vu all over again, because it took the dealership 6 weeks to get the part.

As I got out of the car, one set of keys was in the vehicle.  The car honked at me, which is normal, to warn me the keys were still in it.  When I got back in, the car refused to start.  I saw a message stating there was no key fob detected.  So, back in the dealership I went.  My salesperson told me this happens but the fix is simple.  He placed the key fob in some pocket and started the car.  Off I went thinking that was just a one and done glitch.  This was only the beginning.  A few weeks later I was at the grocery store where I parked and walked in.  After about 20 minutes I came back out and started the car.  My phone refused to connect to the bluetooth.  I power cycled the audio system and that didn\\'t fix it.  I re-paired the phone with the car and that worked.  This was the first of MANY times I had to reconnect my phone to the car.  One night while driving there was a message on the screen stating my brakes were failing.  When I applied the brakes the car would shudder but still stop.  I got out at my destination and when I came back, the error was gone and the issue seemed to resolve itself.  So far there have been five unscheduled trips to the Chevy dealership where I was told there was nothing wrong with car even after showing them video of the issue occurring and one time while actually at the dealership with a technician in the car.  One time I shut the car off and the stereo kept playing like it\\'s supposed to do.  Once you open the door it\\'s supposed to shut off.  It didn\\'t.  Kept playing.  I got out, shut the doors and it still kept playing.  I was even able to place a phone call (to the Chevy service department) from outside my car even though that should not have happened.  I was told nothing was wrong and that was normal operation.  Fed up, I told my service advisor to keep the car until all of the issues have been resolved.  The end result?  They replaced the human/machine interface which seemed to have resolved my audio system issues.  They also replaced the module that controls the key fob problem I was having.  It seems there have been multiple issues reported and they finally found and fixed the issue.  Imagine that.  The start/stop will drive you mad.  The only way to bypass that \"feature\" is to place the transmission into \"Manual Mode\", or \"L\" on the gear selector, hit the \"+\" symbol until you reach, \"6\" on the display and drive it normally.  It effectively places the transmission into dumb mode and the stop/start won\\'t activate.  So, to recap:  Failure to start due to key fob undetected:  Five times.  Failure to connect to my phone:  Stopped counting after 37 times.  Brake anomaly:  One time.  Finally, if you\\'re considering this car:  Don\\'t do it.  Sure, it\\'s great on gas but that\\'s about all it\\'s great on.  When the lease is up, my nightmare will end.',\n",

Next was the car breaking on its own when slightly pressing on the breaks gm says they can’t replicate the issue so still not fixed to this day. Next is the very dangerous lack of power when going from a stop or Red light the car slowly lurches forward and will take a long time to get up to the speed limit dealership told me that’s the way it’s supposed to be and if I don’t like it get a new car after taking it to them 4 times was told to never come back to the dealership. Last but not least the suspension squeaks bad already taken it in multiple times for attempts to fix at least they finally could replicate something lol so they ended up after the 3rd trip for this issue they replaced the front suspension because it was rubbing up against the frame of the car so the front now don’t squeak but now the rear suspension is squeaking so back to the dealership again.

Engine was actually assembled in Mexico.The hood has a strange overhang that obstructs part of the front windshield, creating a bathtub effect.The car has large flared fenders in the rear that make the vehicle seem as wide as a typical mid-size car, but in reality the passenger compartment is claustrophobic.Rear seat room is a complete joke. The middle seat is basically unusable. The left rear and right rear passenger seats are incredibly snug, leaving very little legroom. Passengers over 5\\'11\" will find that the top of their heads sit less than an inch from the window in the rear hatchback.Brake feel was uneven and stopping distance was disappointingly long.Windshield wipers remind me of the Ford Fiesta or the Chevy Spark - very cheap and flexible with blades that drag across the windshield even in heavy rain.The trunk is incredibly shallow, in spite of the fact that no spare tire is provided.The only thing that impressed during the test drive was the electric drive. The powertrain operated silently and delivered acceptable performance on the highway.The 2016 Volt redesign improved a ridiculous car to the point that the vehicle is now below average.Hopefully Chevy will get this vehicle right in Gen 3, but for now I would stay away from the Volt and any other Chevrolet product.',\n",
       "  ' The Sonic Turbo Premier is hilarious to drive (for a day or two) while my ten year old BMW X3 is in the shop for age-related repairs and maintenance. \"Hilarious\" as in \"It\\'s a joke\", not it\\'s actually fun to drive. First off, my 10 year old Bimmer, worth about half of what you can buy this Chevy Sonic for, still vastly outperforms it and is a ton more fun to drive and feels safer to boot. So much for \"Would I ever consider owning this vehicle?\". The answer is a resounding NO! Why not? I mean first impressions are of this car are not so bad. The exterior styling is not crazy or terrible. It is not good either. It just is. The Sonic sedan has a very basic, neutral car shape, the kind you get when you ask a toddler to draw a car. It is somewhat narrow and short but tall when compared to our BMW 328i, almost like Chevy took a Malibu and just trimmed off some excess fat on the sides, rear and front. The cabin is not a terrible place for an econo box. It appears roomy enough, has quite a few gadgets, buttons and a touch screen (in this trim level) and the plastics LOOK decent. All of these judgements, however, vanish when you start driving it. While there is plenty of headroom, even for tall people, legroom is cramped, not just in the back but also annoyingly in the driver seat. I am six foot tall and my legs are too long for a comfortable use of the left foot rest or the accelerator and brake pedals when I adjust the seat to allow a normal arm distance to the steering wheel. (Gorillas with really long arms might do better.) Visibility is not great either. Although the windshield is large, the short stubby hood just vanishes from view and it is very difficult to get a feel for where the front of the car starts. Rear visibility and right side visibility is severely compromised by the enormous headrests (which clearly come from a full size truck and take up most of the airspace of this small car). Once you start touching the visually decent plastic trim you realize that it is not the softer, richer material it masquerades as, but very cheap, basic hard plastic straight from a Yugo. But now to the truly hilarious part of driving this car, its performance. I drove it mostly in town with speed limits around 45 miles per hour. At first I thought I was going way too fast until a look at the speedometer informed me that I was actually chugging along about five miles below the speed limit! The car feels strained and bothered when driven at speeds greater than 35 - 40 mph. Still this is not yet the most fun you can have with the Sonic Turbo. Go find an empty stretch of road without speed bumps (like the access road to my work\\'s parking lot) and floor it.

       "  \" Avis at OC John Wayne airport stuck me with a Chevy Cruze on my last trip to SoCalif in May 2017.  Bummer.  I had fun to drive VW Jetta the last time.  The accelerator pedal on the Cruze felt like I was modulating a bungee cord with virtually no acceleration unless I floored it.  The brakes were a little grabby but OK.  There's nothing special about this car, not especially fun to drive, not very nimble but acceptable.  The auto Stop/Start was a royal pain.  The only way I could disable it (sometimes) was if I left the air conditioner ON.  Apparently the engine needs to be running in order to power the air conditioner - but that only worked sometimes.   I thought I would get better throttle response by shifting the transmission out of Drive and into the next lower setting.  If I did that while stopped the engine would just rev up to redline and wouldn't shift as I sped up.  If I was already in motion then manually down shifted, it would sometimes stay in the lower setting with better throttle response and not rev up so high.  It would 'shift'.  Weird.  I say 'shift' because I'm not sure if this is a real transmission or a CVT.  In any case, it was annoying!  The VW Jetta is also an inexpensive sedan and I found it be a far better car all around, much more spirited, and no silly quirks like the Chevy Cruze.  I ask Avis if I can get the Jetta again on my next trip.  I'll try to avoid the Cruze.\",\n",

The vehicle has TONS of room, and overall was a very smooth and comfortable ride.  I'm not sure why people are complaining about the acceleration.  If buying one, I would go into the purchase decision knowing that I am buying it for safety and cargo capacity, not acceleration.  With nearly 300 HP, it accelerates just fine.  No, you won't blow a sports car away, but it will handle basic driving tasks just fine (i.e., city driving and passing on the highway).  That said, the vehicle falls very short in terms of modern technology, as well as some basic amenities most family oriented vehicles seem to have.  The center console seems intrusive and not really functional.  The cargo door does not automatically raise or lower itself, and there doesn't seem to be a way to control this from the driver's seat either.  The center entertainment console looks like it is a 1st generation console; possibly from the early 2000s.  The gauge cluster gives you trip information and mileage, that's it.  No distance-to-empty, which even our 2011 Sonata (base model) has.  The rear view camera seems a bit slow to respond, but works okay.  Climate control seems lacking, though is very effective.  For example, there are climate control knobs for rear passengers, but if they're kids (in our case), they can't reach them.  In our mini-van they can reach them fine.  No dual-zone controls for the driver / passenger either.  With that said, the air-conditioning and heating works excellent.  Overall, I can't imagine anyone buying this SUV unless they were only concerned with cargo capacity.  Unless you step up to the Premier level, the vehicle is simply out-classed by competitors (my opinion).\",\n",

None of this is convenient for the driver!  I'd be happier with a simple sliding control knob to turn my heat up and down.  I also HATE the fact that the heater/vent/air info does not stay up on the screen.  In order to see where your heat or air is set you need to hit a button to bring the info back up on the screen.....again and again.  I also HATE the location and lack of adjusting ability of the drivers side vents.  The one by the door is practically useless!  You can't turn it up high enough to feel the air on your face.

The two plastic molding strips on the roof started to come off (going down the highway with those flapping around isn't fun), the pins in the back to raise/lower the cargo cover went missing, the breaks in the cold/early morning hours are very sensitive at first. The other thing to note is the cabin pressure when closing the back passenger doors. If the front door/doors or a window is open, the back doors will close with ease...but should all the doors and windows be closed, if you open the back doors and close it, you will need to slam the door hard in order for it to close all the way. I was first told that it was because the doors didn't fit right, then I was told it was because of the cabin pressure and there is no way of fixing that issue, so you will have to learn to slam the door hard to get it closed.

The front seats of the Impala are comfortable for highway cruising and if you are a fat dude they offer a wide seat pan. But for the rest of us, especially if you are used to a Japanese or Euro sedan, these seats are lousy when cornering, as they offer zero ( and I mean zero) lateral support. You may as well be sitting at a bus stop. Also the design of the front compartment means the space around your body and legs is closed in, and feels less roomy than my 2015 Malibu. The engine is meek at low revs, but nail it and the v6 growls and responds nicely. Plenty of passing power! Just don't do that around a curve because although the suspension can handle it, those flat wide seats cannot, and you'll be slammed against the door. Gas mileage was okay in a few days of mostly highway driving-- low to mid 20's. if you really need a big back seat and trunk in an American sedan, this is a nice vehicle and a good value.

I was intrigued with the Volt given its claimed all-electric range of 50+ miles (both the Ford and Toyota claim all-electric ranges in the 20+ mile range). After test driving all 3 of these plug-in vehicles, I ended up purchasing the Prius Prime Advanced. In spite of the higher all-electric mode range, I didn't choose the Volt for the following reasons (in this order):  1) - lack of an integral navigation system - I was really surprised at this, but navigation requires linking your smartphone to provide this capability.  While I have a smartphone that works fine for nav, I don't want to have to deal with connecting it, etc.  I just want the car to do the work.   2) - front seats - completely manual in the high-end version of the Volt. Expected at least a power seat on the driver's side. I am tall, so used to sliding the seat back and lowering it.  In the Volt, lowering the seat requires manually pumping the seat up or down.  3) Internal finish. The Volt interior is not bad, but did not impress me as being high quality. The interior of the Toyota felt much more luxurious - especially the very large glass panel display that dominates the middle of the cockpit.  Even though this writeup is about the Volt, I will also mention that I did not decide on the Ford Fusion mainly because the trunk space is almost non-existent - the battery is mounted such that you could put a few small items in the trunk and that's it.\",\n",

On the second full day of driving the vehicle I felt comfortable enough to pay attention to other aspects of the car besides just learning where things are located. I then became aware that the car is very noisy on rough roads. This is after I verified the pressure of the tires was as recommended by the manufacturer in the morning, cold temperature. Another thing that happened was I hit my shin twice on the fancy overly sculptured dash over the course of the week. It was bad enough that it drew blood both times. This happened  as i got comfortable with the car. Lastly I have one very odd and alarming incident where the car was on cruise control, 50 mph, and as the car started to go into a downhill portion of the road I started to hear clicking like a relay from the front left side of the engine compartment and the car started to hesitate. I wasn’t sure if it was the cruise control trying to adjust the speed or if there was some transmission issue trying to engage and disengage the drive system. That didn’t happen again but I didn’t go down that same road again either so I’m not able to verify if that’s a continuing problem.

Firstly, the well designed phone storage slot to the right of the gearshift is NOT equipped with the wireless charger.  Instead, it's located at the fore of the compartment under the armrest.

The seats are very narrow and offer minimal padding. Let me say that I am only 5\\'11\" and 183# so not a big guy by an stretch. There are minor annoyances on a car that costs this much like not including telescoping sun visors, Android auto only works plugged in via USB instead of wireless (which is frustrating since I have the wireless phone charging option that is rendered moot by having to plug the phone in), no usb port next to the phone holder under the infotainment system but these are all livable issues but the seats are really bothersome. Make sure you spend plenty of time in the seats on your test drive before you buy. Also check out some of the Chevy Bolt forums to see others that are experiencing similar issues.',\n",
       "  \" I didn't intend to get a new car, but drove the Bolt at an environmental organization's EV fair.  I was very impressed.  I have so far not been disappointed overall.  I wish Apple CarPlay enabled maps other than the standard Apple Maps for use on the large touchscreen.  I wish the front seats were more comfortable, though I like the leather on mine.  The safety features--lane warning, blind spot warning, front collision warning, backup camera and guide--are all excellent.  (I should add that I have driven only a Prius Prime with similar features.)  I do wish the left side of dashboard, white in my car, didn't reflect in the outside mirror so significantly.  Overall it's a terrific car, one I hadn't expected of an American brand.  Oh yes, I very much like the Arctic Blue Metallic exterior because it didn't cost extra as the deeper blue, the red, and the orange do.\",\n",

       "  \" My experience with the Bozarth Lone Tree location has been horrible.  If it wasn't for the owner I really would have nothing positive to say.  To begin, I was sold a car with incorrect mileage info on the title, relutant to clean the car before releasing it to me, no manufacturer manual, problems with service maintenance on issues that existed prior to the purchase.  Unbelievably rude and unprofessional behavior.  With that stated, the actions of a few overshadow the good works of those who do care about providing excellent customer service and follow thru.  I had to complain to the actual owner Ed Bozarth in order to get these problems addressed I was amazed and pleased with the solutions he presented to address these problems.  I also appreciate the manager of maintenance and his staff member, Ed for addressing an exterior problem with my car after yet another poor customer service issue erupted.  There are good top management within this dealership.  It is unfortunate that I had to complain and struggle to be treated as a valued customer and be respected woman.  My experience was traumatic, cautioc and trying.  I hope no other woman has had to go to such lengths to receive ethical customer service and integrity.\",\n",
       "  ' Great truck all around-mostly satisfied for now. I’ve been driving 90% of the time in the city and getting around 19mpg. I bought the truck in October 2017. I came from a vehicle that had push button start and keyless entry...taking some time to get used to the old way of having to get the fob out of my pocket to unlock and insert to start the truck. I admit that’s probably a bit picky but for a 38K truck in 2017...why? The 2nd issue is the nav screen...it worked correctly for a week and then on the map screen everything shifted up 1/4 of the screen. (So it’s cut off...can’t see the whole map) I took it in to get it checked out and was told it’s probably a software update issue but that my truck was up to date. “Check back at your first oil change” :/  I’m about a month away from needing that soooo we shall see. Overall: I’m very pleased, it’s checked off all of my boxes for a mid size truck. ',\n",

I'm still getting to know the truck but so far so good!!   Here are some things I wish the truck had: 1. Rock sliders that are attached to the frame and instead of the body.  I also wished the sliders protruded out so they can double as steps.  2. It would be nice to have a 110v power outlet  and an on board air compressor.  3. A power sliding rear window.  4.  More anchor points in the truck bed.  5.  More grab handles!!  The driver does not have a grab handle on the A pillar.   I would like to have one to use getting in the vehicle.  Passenger grab handles about the windows would be nice.   6. A better blind spot mirror in the driver side.  The passenger side could also use one.  7. Provisions for auxiliary light switches for ADDITIONAL off road lights.  The one button incorporated in the rotary knob for the head lights is RIDICULOUSLY SMALL!  It's a joke!  8.  Accessories that are compatible with the light bar that is bolted to the truck bed.  Because of this light bar, I can't install a tool box or tonneau cover .  These little things would make this truck more utilitarian  and better than most.\",\n",

       "  ' PROS: Handling and driving is smooth, comfortable and car-like, nicest driving truck I have ever owned (out of Toyotas and Fords).  The exterior is a head turner.  Stereo is fantastic, loud and full, sounds great.  8\" touchscreen is nice and very responsive (unlike Ford\\'s sync which is slow and laggy), menus can get a little deep and hard to set up items.  CONS: On-Star is a joke and most features look to be worthless if you don\\'t pay the On-Star subscription.  To use On-Star navigation, you have to call them and tell a rep over the phone where you want to go.  There is no map, only an arrow and a mileage countdown before a turn...a little bummed out I didn\\'t get a real nav system.  More CONS: interior (even on the Z71) is the cheapest plastic.  The eyeglass holder and seat controls feel like they will break due to the thin plastic. The gray interior color on the seats looks more like a blue color, so you get a bluish on gray and black interior...funky.  Every single cup holder is ridiculously small.  The door pockets are useless, unless you are storing lipstick or pencils.  The cup holders in the door are too small and angled weird. Rear under seat storage in the crew cab is dismal.  Why could they not make it a \"box\" like so many aftermarket storage systems?  Interior lighting placement is bad.  Power seats are limited to how you can position them.  The key fob and ignition key are two different pieces (why can\\'t the key be integrated into the fob like everyone else?).   Quality: Had lots of loose and or broken trim pieces on both exterior and interior that needed to be replaced (window control housing, fog lamp trim, wheel well trim).  Within first 200 miles got DEF warning lights about the diesel fluid quality and warnings that the vehicle would be restricted to 65 MPH max if the problem was not resolved....I was in the middle of the desert..... At 500 miles the transmission would not shift beyond 3rd gear.  Dealer claims a manufacturing defect/metal shavings stuck in the valve body.  For a small, $36k+ truck, I would expect way better interior quality and quality control overall.',\n",

Dealers and GM tout this car, but do not prepare us for the severe drop in milage that even a mild drop in temperature can cause. If you live in the part of the country that experiences temperature changes, have a another car available that can run on gas. I do. It is a sin that we do not use the technology that has been available for years and could make electric and run for hundreds of miles. One day we will drive into a station, have the battery removed and replaced in less time that it takes to fill the car with gas. I would still buy this car again. As I noted, it drives extremely well, has great pickup, silent and a gift to our planet. It could use a much more comfortable front seats.

But that's an issue with most pickups and it's closer competitor, the Tacoma, doesn't have those either.  I didn't think the Apple Car Play would be all that important to me.

The front seats are good and can fit two big dudes no problem provided you stagger the seatbacks a little. Android Auto is fantastic. The CVT isn't. If you can drive manual or want to learn this would be a great car to do so, especially with the hill holder feature - the CVT is angry, doesn't like to rev, and will leave you motionless from a stop on steep hills unless you throw it into L. Don't be afraid to use the L mode on hills, up or down. Otherwise this car is very easy to park, good on gas, and painless to drive in traffic. It's actually kind of fun to throw into curves too. Just know that if you have tall people in the front seats no one is going to be sitting behind them.

Apparently there are no subcompacts made in the US.

Better fuel economy, much more storage space with both the 3rd row up and down and from the drivers perspective, much more fun to drive as it handles very well and as I said previously, has such a smooth ride. The down side? The infotainment center isn't as up to date and user friendly as the Journey, it won't connect to my iphone 5s so I can't use the texting or pandora features, it doesn't have the auto unlock feature where all the doors unlock when the driver grabs the door handle, it starts with a key instead of a button start which means I have to get used to having my keys out when I leave where before I could just leave them in my purse and my final gripe is that it doesn't have a digital speedometer!!  I have had a digital speedometer since my 2012 DodgeCaravan and I am finding it hard adjusting to actually having to read the speedometer instead of just glancing down to see the digital number. I do believe that all of these features I don't like were eliminated with the 2018 Traverse so in 2 years when I turn in my lease, if I were to get another one and those features were upgraded, I would give it 5 starts\",\n",

The Equinox is roomy, handles very nicely, seats are very comfortable, especially with the 8 way power driver seat.  It's quiet, has a nice interior and is spacious. The 2018 redesign is smaller which is why I went with the 17 - roomier seating and more cargo space.  I also like the reclining rear seats, which I don't believe the 2018 had.

The seat is similar with the Chevy Cruze, the front of the seat does not tilt down far enough and feel like sitting in the bucket. I wish the seat has five more degrees of travel. I\\'m thinking of taking the vehicle back to have a 1/2 inch spacers added to the rear of the seat. All the money GM spent studying seats, and they still did not get it right. They need to improve is the driver\\'s seat and provide more adjustment.Update: Dealer did not want to install the spacers so I did it myself.

We bought the 2.4L 2WD because we were interested in fuel economy, but the mileage that we're getting doesn't really support our decision - it's much poorer than we figured it would be considering the relatively low vehicle weight (about 3700 lb).  The acceleration likewise was surprisingly bad.  That said, we're happy with the vehicle - the interior is nicely appointed with lots of conveniences, although we had to buy the LT version to get hands-free bluetooth and back-up camera.   We wanted GPS as well but would have had to spend more to get the LTZ version.  One surprise is that Chevy doesn't want you to maintain your own transmission fluid level, so there's no dipstick for the transmission.\",\n",
       "  \" The last time I owned a Chevy was 20 years ago. That was when I bought a Subaru, which lasted the 20 years, with few complaints. The only reason I did not buy another one is they moved out of my budget. The last Chevy I owned, I had to work on it every weekend so I could drive it during the week. Chevy's quality has improved dramatically, except there is still driver window air noise, and the paint is still suspect, scratches too easily and with 6 stone chips in the hood already ( 13 months), and no I don't follow gravel trucks.  The trunk space is lacking, can't fit golf clubs without the back seats down. The good? The mileage is phenomenal, 41 mpg+ on the highway, 33 mpg combined. I got the Bose sound system, and it of course provides great sound. It is quite comfortable, and drove several hours on a road trip with no seat fatigue. They could put a 3 sec. delay in the Auto-Stop feature, for when a stop is only temporary, but you can crawl through a stop sign or kick it in neutral if you want to by pass it. I think this would be a better car for a young person, as it has all the communications you could ask for, I think. It has good acceleration, handles well except in deep snow, and is fun to drive.\",\n",

Seats are reasonably comfortable but seat bottoms could use more padding to reduce pressure points on longer trips.  Overall this 2017 Malibu is competitive with its Asian competiton except, of course, on the thorny issue of long term mechanical component reliability and durability which also reduces Malibu's resale value.\",\n",

Anything but and the ride is as choppy and bouncy as my 2016 Jeep Cherokee(which is an appropriate ride for an SUV). Road impacts e.g potholes, manholes are loud and harsh for such a solid feeling chassis. Shifts are great unless you try evasive driving, three point turns or lift off and quickly accelerate again. Transmission moves to such a high gear, car barely moves or bogs down to no go which has become a huge safety concern for me. Full throttle, part throttle, nothing fixes it. God help you if a train is coming. Car auto stop feature has not returned car to on a couple of times when coming to full stop before a merge into traffic. Interior looks great except for uneven gaps, yellow foam from front seats showing. Navigation is voice request - call to get directions - no map. Android Auto works great but miss my Dodge that had great navigation options included with price of vehicle for five years. Road noise on all but new roads. Gas mileage is great, diesel is quiet in almost all situations.

       "  ' I\\'ve had my white Grand Sport convertible with 8-speed auto transmission for eight months now and I still absolutely love her.  I\\'ve put 9,300 miles on her; the first 2,000 a very careful break-in, then 7,000 miles of grand touring driving: from Austin, Texas to Key West, Florida and back by way of the southern Appalachian mountains, then a quick trip from Austin to Denver and back.  Plus some \\'spirited\\' driving on the back roads around Austin.  You definitely will want a good radar + laser detector, plus Waze on your smart device if you drive this machine!  And after those eight months I am still head-over-heels in love with my baby (I named her \"Emoji\" because from the front the headlights and grill give her the look of one of those slanty-eyed happy face emoticons).  This car is, in my opinion, the sweet spot of the Corvette lineup, and the culmination of seven generations of engineering.  This is a supercar in everything but price.  For the  price of a Ferrari F12 you can buy FIVE Grand Sports and have enough left over to buy gas for all for a year each, probably, and yet lap times for each are pretty much identical (ok, in Car & Driver\\'s Lightning Lap face-off the GS bests the F12 by several seconds around Virginia International Raceway).  This is a car that is at home on twisty backroads, the Autobahn, and the racetrack, and there are not that many production cars that can come close to the performance, gas mileage, and grand touring comfort - and possibly none for the price.  Very few cons, in my opinion: 1) Limited luggage capacity in the convertible, but much better in the coupe; 2) not a car for winter driving in snow/ice climates, as there are no winter/snow tires available; 3) visibility, especially on the rear quarters, could be better; 4) seats could use more lateral support for a car capable of 1.1 G lateral force when cornering on street tires (but they are miles ahead of previous generation Corvette seats, and actually do provide some lateral support!);  5) if you value privacy you will get tired of people complimenting you when stopped at traffic lights! :)  Other than that there\\'s really very little that I find annoying about this wonderful machine.  Highly recommended, if you are  in the market for a two-seater touring/racing/sports car.  And I haven\\'t even mentioned things like the dry-sump lubrication (keeps the engine oiled during hard cornering/accel/braking), magnetic shock absorbers (monitors road conditions and adjusts the ride 180 times a second for road/driving conditions), and phenomenal braking ability (70-0 in 136 feet on stock tires!), nor have I mentioned the vastly-improved cabin appointments, with heated/ventilated seats, passenger climate controls on the passenger vent, heads-up instrumentation, etc. etc.).  Oh, and this website does not seem to allow line breaks, so sorry for the one big run-on paragraph.  Respectfully, Delta Foxtrot, Austin, Texas.',\n",

       "  \" I've always been a Ford guy so impressing me is hard with the way most GM products work.  This thing packs a pretty decent bang for buck as we tested an explorer, Santa fe, and pathfinder. If the deal would have gone right we'd honestly have the pathfinder as that had the most overall refined feel and features for the price. As the dealership that had it was horrible we found the traverse as a happy medium with the lt2 package. Sound from the radio is amazing and between that and the quiet cabin it really drowns out the subpar engine as it winds up to use every ounce of power it has to get moving. I'm not kidding when I say this thing lacks power... it's really bad and I find myself 2nd guessing myself passing quite a bit. Inside the cabin is quite roomy with a couple quirks that don't ruin your experience. For instance, when you turn the car off with Bluetooth audio on you'd expect it to be the first thing that comes up when you get back in the vehicle. This isn't the case at all and it's slightly annoying. Also the cup holders in the middle part of the cabin are right on the door (w/captains chairs). Not sure if the bench is the same but this is a disaster with children slamming doors on road trips. Last thing is the auto windows. They're only auto down... not up. Not sure who thought of this but having to roll this thing up and down 5 days a week to show an ID at a gate makes this very irritating. It really seems small but makes a huge difference. Other than that features on this are very good and it seems very well put together and kid proof. Cargo space is very lacking with all seats up but if you can fold a seat this really opens up the area. If you can't I'd suggest a full size SUV and not a crossover. Visibility out of the front and behind you is adequate but there is a huge blind spot on the vehicle thats caused me to buy bubble mirrors. Gas mileage is about the same as our old F150 with low 20s for mixed driving so we can afford it. Others may find this bad and I'd agree and suggest the fix is an engine that won't work as hard to get this thing moving (drive the explorer with the ecoboostto see what I mean). The vehicle handles turns and bumps extremely well with what you'd expect from this body style of car with the standard dead feel in the wheel. So far there are very few manufactures that can really put feel into their cars and give then soul so this isn't a killer for me.  Over all we like it and we're pleased with the purchase and look forward to having this thing for some time.Update 2018Feb21:As winter really set in up in ND we found our heat was having issues and would not blow hot air all the time so we called the dealer to arrange fixing (not a big deal these things happen. I can accept that). After the service counter hears my problem they then ask me if my car is throwing a code or running funny so i let them know everything is normal except the heat. After this im informed that as my car was not running funny or throwing a code they would not fix it under warranty but i could pay to have it fixed... Is this not why a manufacturer warranty exists on a vehicle? I fought for a couple days with them as in ND during the winter it is dangerous to not have heat and talked to the dealer i purchased it from gently used. They more than willingly made a deal on another car (that they can fix (hyundai)) and got us out of the vehicle so as to avoid have us pulling our hair out over a grey area.A vehicle is only as good as the warranty the manufacturer is willing to service it under and if they cant honor that then they dont deserve to have me represent their brand. Because of this situation i find it very doubtful i will ever buy a chevy again as it left a hole in my wallet and a sour taste in my mouth. Yes i could have paid to have it fixed but what happens when the same thing happens another 10k miles down the road or something else comes up the warranty will not honor? I refuse to leave any boxes unchecked and will not have my family suffer because they cant do something they should be expected to. Decent vehicle overall but do homework on warrantied items and weather your dealer will homor them before representing a brand u could regret down the road.\",\n",

Even though it is American made, the quality of the car is top notch and it feels very well built.  So far I have found almost zero things to complain about with this vehicle.  The stock exhaust note is great because its isn't insanely loud but it is definitely loud enough and the acceleration is mind boggling. I have yet to come even close to pushing this car to the limit and in all honesty I don't think I ever will.  Its surprisingly comfortable as well and if you put it into touring mode the suspension becomes very soft and supple which is something I never would have expected. If there is one thing that I can complain about, it would have to be the traction that seems almost impossible to get any time you hit the gas peddle even a little bit.  It isn't necessarily touchy but you have to be very cautious and aware that the backend will get loose very quickly. Another thing that I love about my z06 is the exterior styling.

Honestly, it's easily as nice as our 2007 BMW 3-series was inside, and handles almost as well, incredibly. The car has been flawless so far, and feels incredibly solid and quiet, especially considering my expectations. Winter driving has also been beyond expectations, even though it's just a front-drive car with all-season tires. Our mileage approaches 40mpg on the highway, although for city driving in cold weather it's been in the low 20s. We test-drove a Cadillac ATS at the dealer with the 2.0L turbo engine, and this car could compete with a VW GTI if that engine were an option (I've had one of those, as well)\",\n",
       "  \" Buy the gen 2 Cruze, 2017 or newer. You'll also want the 1.4L turbo engine, my last Cruze had 181k trouble free miles on that drive train. If your budget allows definitely get the premier trim, it's well worth the cost. I really have no negative comments on this car. If you are looking for a vehicle that offers many high end options at an inexpensive price while returning impressive fuel mileage, low operating cost and outstanding reliability, then this is your car.  I chose the 2017 premier hatchback, it comes equipped with heated front & rear leather seats, heated steering wheel, 8 inch touch screen my link radio, Bose sound system, turn by turn navigation and too many other options to list.\",\n",
       "  \" Even with a bit of a heavy foot I still get an average of 29 MPG whil driving about 90% in town. Its a solid overall car that has some great lines and can be pretty much outfit just the way you want. It's worth a drive in either Automatic or Manual. The bluetooth / apple carplay / android auto are great and make it more affordable than having to add options or go up trim levels for something so easy to replicate.\",\n",
       "  ' I had a 2011 Equinox LT that I traded in for a 2017.   I wanted the same body style I had - before the 2018 redesign.  I found a gently used fleet vehicle they classified as LT w/ 1LT.  It\\'s loaded.  Heated seats, temperature control, running lights, etc.  Don\\'t need all that, but it is fun to have.  I\\'m getting 29.1 mpgs commuting, which is better than the 2011.  Can\\'t wait to see what it does on the highway on a long trip!  I like the Equinox so much I\\'ve bought two of them now.  It\\'s the perfect size for my needs.  It gets me from point A to point B safely and in comfort and all the tall people in my family can fit in this vehicle.  6\\' 3\" inches in the back seat, no problem.  I have back issues and the seats in these vehicles are wonderful.  I can go long distances with no discomfort.  It is easy to get in and out of and I have plenty of room to move and haul anything and everyone.  Plenty of room for the pets and crates too.  It may not be the perfect vehicle for everyone, but it\\'s the perfect vehicle for me.  I love my Equinox!',\n",

       "  ' Have the Hatchback Premier the ride is quieter then Civic . More cormfotable the Madza 3. The Ford Focus needs a lot of improvement to even be in a class with the Cruze . For the money Cruze is a contender and you add the mileage savings that equals a winner',\n",
       "  \" I've always had Asian cars and German cars but I wanted to give it a try to American cars and I chose the Cruze. I couldn't be more surprised with this car and how smooth it drives. The interior design is beautiful and it's very comfortable. I'm a 6 ft guy and even though the back seat can have more head room, it's very comfortable to be a small car. The front seats are very comfortable, ironically I think the hatchback is more comfortable than the sedan (my opinion). The auto start and stop feature is awesome, it's a very smooth transition and you won't even notice it. The auto start feature is a lot better than BMW's which is not as smooth as the chevy's. It's very quiet and smooth on the road, you barely can feel harsh roads. I'm a commuter so I do not care much about power. MPG is amazing as well. I'm also impressed with the technology. I'm sure Chevrolet will keep improving this car. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this car!!\",\n",
       "  ' This car was made for today.   It shines in the city, country, and the highway.   The \"Auto Stop\" (car shuts off at stops to conserve gas), was a little disconcerting at first; however, when you see your city gas mileage, you don\\'t mind.  On those long lonesome country 60 MPH roads, you can get nearly 40 mile MPG.  And, even with all this fuel economy, this car is quick and nibble at freeway speeds.  After coming from the city, and taking it easy on a 50 mile trip to visit in-laws in the country, I got 38 miles to the the gallon (without AC on), on my way to their home.  Coming home, we were running a little late, and in freeway city traffic, my Cruze was so nibble and quick darting around the clustered traffic at freeway speeds, it was almost incredible.  My car has remote & push-button start, and I can unlock the doors by touching the handles.  After getting to work and waiting in my Cruze to punch-in for my shift, I switch the car off and the radio and electric windows still operate, until I exit the vehicle, which is a great feature.  I read one review where the person was bemoaning the \"Auto Stop\", while trying to pull into traffic quickly.  I found if you anticipate a quick move coming, you merely have to be proactive and step on the accelerator a couple of seconds before going to take it out of the \"Auto Stop\" mode.  This hasn\\'t been an issue and I live in the City.  With the RS package and the addition of my fog lights to the front grill, this car is a looker.  Even though the Cruze Hatchback isn\\'t rated quite as high as some of the other Hatchbacks, I beg to differ.   This car is all things to most people and a great value.  Did I say it corners like butter.   This car is a sleeper.After 6 months, still really enjoying my Chevy Cruze Hatchback.  I\\'ll put my Cruze against any of the other Hatchbacks in appearance and luxuries.   With my factory push button start, keyless entry, and remote start, really enjoying my car this winter.   10 mins. before punching out at my Michigan  job, I use my remote start to deice my windows, warm the engine, and heat the seats.  A little slice  of heaven in a very unkind world.   I also like the feature of being able to control the electrics on my car like the windows, wiper, and etc. for 10 minutes after stopping the engine.  Even after 10 mins I can still listen to the radio until I go in to punch in.   Because of the winters and remote start, gas mileage has really suffered, but a price I\\'m willing to pay to make my life so much easier during the harsh MI winter.   The car is also quick with its little turbo charged engine.  Deserves a look, if shopping for a car.  And, one more thing, leg room in the back seat is great for a car of this size, particularly in comparison with almost every other hatchback.',\n",
       "  ' The only complaint I have is that the paint on the vehicle seems to be paper thin. I have a new chip or ding every day. I bought a paint repair pen and it has been difficult keeping up.',\n",
       "  ' Several good points with our 2017 Chevy Cruze Premier Hatchback:  1) Though my wife is the main driver, I can fit in it comfortably at 6\\'6\".  Try that with a Ford Escape on a long trip.  2) Very peppy.  The 1.4L Turbo has a lot of power - sufficient for us.   3) The ride is super-smooth, like a big luxury car; probably because the Premier model has a Watt\\'s suspension.  4) We use the Apple Car Play with our iPhones and Apple GPS.  My wife buys the unlimited wifi and streams Pandora through the Bluetooth interface. ....  The Auto-Stop can be a bit annoying, but you can keep it from kicking in by braking slowly.  Pay a little extra for a higher model like the Premier and get the cruise control, seat warmers, rear cup holders, etc. ...  Have had no problems so far - Knock on wood!',\n",
       "  ' Traded in a small SUV.  This car is a wonderful surprise.  The handling, transmission and motor provide a sports sedan feel in comparison.  Great gas mileage and logical technology - the WiFi is useful.  Interior and exterior are tight and attractive.',\n",
       "  ' I have not driven my new Z51 LT1 coupe because Chevrolet says that you are not supposed to drive it when the temperature is below 40 degrees and I live in Minnesota so I should be able to drive it by the fourth of July. I put 9 miles on it getting it home and that is all the driving experience I have on it so far. So all I can comment on is the comfort and quality of the things used when they put the C7 together.',\n",
       "  \" Admittedly, this is my first new car so I may be biased. I previously drove a manual 02 Golf. The standard backup camera is amazing (first time having one) and the screen is huge. I use Apple CarPlay regularly. I was a bit worried about the auto stop/start as it has been listed as a con of this car. Honestly, I've never been in the situation that it does not start by the time my foot is on the gas. It starts so quickly that I don't even notice it; I would list this feature as a pro and not a con. It's a very smooth ride. Acceleration is decent but when the turbo kicks it feels pretty fast (compared to my golf). Not sure of fuel economy yet. I did see that at one point it listed 39 mpg as the best I've gotten but I hear you need to let it break in before getting accurate readings. Love the cargo space (as does my dog) and I actually keep the seats down most of the time with a blanket in the back. I really love the interior; feels pretty luxurious for a car of this price but again, I'm coming from an 02 Golf. The only con is that it feels a bit top heavy around turns compared to the Golf. I see that Chevy has a new suspension kit to make it a little bit stiffer; I might install that soon. Having a button for an ignition took some getting used to (convenience package) but now I'm a fan.\",\n",
       "  \" Highlights: I drive pot hole infested roads up a mountain to work and the suspension soaks up the craters and cracks like a champ.  Transmission is unexpectedly smooth as well.  I also like the diesel-like throttle mapping, as it allows you to drive very smoothly and efficiently.  But if you need to speed up in a hurry, you feel that turbo kick in with a lot less lag time than other diesels I've driven.  The cabin is very well muted for its class.  The amount of technology you get for the price is also impressive.  I have the convienence package as well.  The steering has a nice balance of responsiveness and road feel.  I would have expected something a lot more numb feeling and sloppy.  The rear legroom, though I don't have passengers often, is FAR larger than expected.  Tall people can sit in the backseat even with the front seats pushed back.             Cons:  None.  This car feels like a great value and seems to punch above its weight in terms of its luxury-like smoothness and solid feel.\",\n",
       "  ' I was in the market for a car with a great cargo space and good gas mileage.  The Cruze Hatch met those requirements plus it has a great interior.  The road noise is  minimal and after a 600 mile road trip, it got great gas mileage that equaled the EPA numbers.  Yes, the auto start-stop does take some time to get used to but it is not intrusive and does not engage in stop and go traffic.   Surprisingly the back seats has more leg room than the SUV I traded in, even for someone sitting behind me with my long legs.   The one issue is that the headrests do block a lot of the rear vision out of the back window.  I really did not notice this in the daytime but at night on the expressway, it is something to be aware off.  But all in all, I am happy with it and one of my coworkers liked it so much he got one too.',\n",

       "  ' I\\'ve had the 2017 Premier for a few weeks now. Traded in my 2014 impala 2LT for an upgraded version. Its the same car as before only much nicer interior. I\\'m not impressed by infotainment and leather, I want them but thats not why I got another Impala. I got it because it drives like a dream.  Acceleration at low speeds is very good, at highway speeds it awesome. It handles like a performance car when cornering. Its interior is very quite which make driving any distance a pleasure. Cargo space is excellent and my passengers in the back seat are amazed at how much room they have and how comfortable it is. I\\'ve watched the maintenance reviews from other drivers and its been a solid car. Gas mileage is what you would expect for a full size sedan. If you like bells and whistles, wifi, infotainment, heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel and side mirrors, if you can\\'t live without usb ports and a 120 volt outlet in the back seat well this car will not disappoint you. Did I mention the Bose sound system and oh its got a \"secret\" compartment that I can lock behind the infotainment center that seems to impress everyone that sees it. Seriously, its a great car that doesn\\'t disappoint.',\n",
       "  \" I have only had it for a week, so can't say anything about the reliability or the fuel economy. Had to order it special because I wanted the Adaptive Cruise Control which comes with Forward Automatic Braking (they work great), and the dealers don't stock cars with that option. I really like the built in GPS and maps - no longer have to carry a Garmin on my front shelf. And you can program the GPS by talking to it. Got lost at night the first time we were out, and was able to tell it where I wanted to go, and it got us there.\",\n",

       "  \" I bought the 2017 Chevrolet Sonic LT (Auto) RS Hatchback and added the Convenience & Drivers Confidence Packages to match the goodies of the Premier Trim. There is a reason why I chose the trim I chose; the Hatchback only comes in 2 trims, the LT & Premier, there is a slight difference between the two trims. The LT has an amazingly quiet cabin equal to the highest trim of a $70k+ luxury vehicle, while the Premier has a more lowered suspension and as a result the Premier's cabin is not as quiet. The automatic can also be driven in manual mode without the annoying clutch pedal! The Performance is amazingly sporty for both engines as they both easily pounces from a stop. When applying the breaks it also comes to a smooth stop and when applied quickly It's very fast too! If you want a car that is amazingly quiet and caters to the highest safety standard's, quality and convenience of a luxury car and at the same time not only looks sporty but actually is sporty with the attitude to show inside and out, this is a car worth test driving with the optional packages I have chosen. I call it my mini Lambo because it sits and pampers you like one yet its silent but deadly. It takes Unleaded gas and I get 30-35 MPG with mixed driving, now If you drive it sporty and have fun you will get about 24- 28 mpg which is still amazing. There is a reason this car has muscled It's way into the sports car scene and has been officially recognized. It is the only car so far to get a 5 star rating, the highest across all ratings for the Institute of Highway Safety Standards for such a small car. Everything in the car from the smallest button to the engine, inside and out is amazingly built and solid. You can tell that Chevrolet takes pride in every part of the car even to the smallest stitch. Take a test drive with the optional packages I have chosen and you will see that Chevrolet has built this amazingly rare gem to prove you don't have to spend a fortune to be pampered. I sure hope that this particular model will continue for years to come. There are many mixed reviews about this car in particular often nit-picking at it It is best to go and test drive it.\",\n",
       "  \" 18-Month update: No issues so far.  I love this car.  Though the original wireless charger works on my Android phone, it does not work with iPhone X and 8.  Newer GM models support iPhone, and fortunately there's an upgraded wireless charging module you can purchase for the Impala.   It also improves wireless charging in general.  I purchased it, and it was easy to replace in the Impala.   I love the 20 inch wheels, however I hit a curb and dented a rim, and tore a piece of the sidewall.  $500 to replace. 12-Month update:  We are now into the 2nd Winter for this car, 7.5K miles, and it continues to impress me.  I have had no mechanical or quality issues, and average 21 MPG in mostly local driving (7 mile commute to work).   I'll say it again I really like the remote start feature on my phone.  In the Winter it automatically heats the seat and defrosts the rear window and mirror.  I'll also say again you need snow tires if you get the optional 20 inch wheels and plan to drive in snow or ice.  6-Month update: I still love this car.  Now that Summer is here, I am really enjoying the cooled seats.  A nice feature is the car will turn on the cooled seats when you start the car remotely from the Chevy app or key fob.   The Bose centerpoint surround sound system is incredible.  XM radio sounds ok, but you really need to feed it direct line or bluetooth audio to fully enjoy the 11 speaker system.Original Review: I did a lot of research and was going to get a 2017 Mazda 6 in the Spring  of 2017 to replace my 2007 Mazda 6.  I had looked at Impalas and other big sedans but technology and luxury options pushed them above my budget.  However Chevy offered 20% off MSRP on 2017 Impalas, meaning I could get $8K off a loaded Premier.  I got a Premier in silver every option but the radar cruise control.   The optional 20inch wheels  look great in my opinion.  However those tires are not suited for snow, so I purchased snow tires and wheels from Tire Rack.  The car succeeds in providing a quiet comfortable ride with some decent features.   I have just 2 minor issues so far.  The transmission seems to like to start off in a high gear, I assume for fuel economy, so I have to step on the gas more than I'm used to.  The car has great power, and I love the sound of the V6.  The other issue is with the wireless phone charger,P in the cubby with the door.  The rubber pad is too thick for my phone to charge.  I removed the pad and put a patch of thin rubber carpet backing there to keep the phone from sliding around, so far it works great.  The Impala is compelling and with a 20% off incentive it was a no-brainer for me.\",\n",
       "  ' I agree with another poster who compared the Spark to an early generation Miata.  Consider the following: 1. Did you know the Spark is actually a European design?  It has that European feel and no wonder - it is marketed in several European countries as an Opel “Karl”.  2.  In Consumer Reports tests of around 250 cars in 2017, the Spark was rated either #6 or #7 in their accident avoidance (handling) tests.  It matches the Corvette and the new Miata in this regard.  It also has braking scores in the top 20% or so all cars tested. 3.  Traction control can be completely shut off if you wish. 4. All the (0-60) acceleration tests you see are with the CVT trans which has a notable “bog” off the line.  The 5 speed manual is at least a second quicker.  5. I can reach 50 mpg on the highway occasionally, and rarely if ever get below 40 mpg.  My overall average (5 speed manual) is around 42mpg in mixed driving. Hybrid mileage without the hassles and complexity.  Port injection - no D.I. I find the car similar to a 1st generation GTI in terms of weight and power-and it is also kicks to drive and eminently practical.  It’s kind of a “hidden gem” of a vehicle and a great value for the dollar. It’s a fun to drive car and an exceptional economy car to boot.',\n",
       "  ' This my second Spark, my first was a new 2013 Manual Spark, no cruise control...traded it in last year on a new 2017 Automatic Spark with cruise control....Have been reading the mileage rating and I do better...run Mobil 1 and installed a K&N Airfilter, cruising on the highway at 65mph, I average 46mpg.   Last month I drove from Laughlin NV to Columbia, SC and back, going over I used 52 gallons of gas, coming back I used 53.5 gallons because I decided to take a US Highway to avoid some traffic on I-40.',\n",
       "  ' If you are only going to have one car in the family, the Spark probably isn’t for you.  For me, cars are like tools.  You can’t owe one screwdriver or one wrench and expect to get much done.  My other cars are an F250 to tow my travel trailer and for heavy work around the house, my wife has a KIa Sorrento we use for family outings and the Spark takes me on my 90 mile round trip to work.  After communiting in a diesel F250 for a year, it became apparent to me I could just buy another car with what I’d save on diesel fuel and maintenance.  That math equation turned out to be spot on.  I honestly don’t understand the complaints about power.  The Spark has very close specs to a first generation Miata.  It is around 2300 lbs and just under 100 horsepower.  My commute is in Dallas traffic and I never have issues with acceleration.  To put that into perspective, here is a little background on me.  I raced 125 cc shifter karts for 20 years and I’ve owed some reasonably fast cars over the years, Supercharged Mustang, Mercedes C55 AMG and a few motorcycles, and the Spark accelerates just fine.  It isn’t fast in a straight line but it certainly gets the job done.  The street handling is on par with the NA and NB Miatas I have owned. I’m not taking it to the race track, so the handling limits of the Spark are far beyond what you’d ever need on the street.   That being said, I have one reasonably decent speed right hander on my way home where I frequently find some unpleasant person in some high power car climbing up my rear.  As I enter the corner I can give a slight throttle, lift turn in hard to the apex and hit the throttle and watch them disappear in the mirror.  I can frequently see the car behind with fairly significant body roll under steering while they try to keep up.    Spark too slow?  I think not.  I embarrass cars costing sometimes 10 times as much on a daily basis going around that corner.  The Spark is a hard top Miata with 4 doors.  I only wish to could find one with a manual transmission.   The layout of the dash is very intuitive and the radio is fantastic. I don’t know how I lived before Apple Car Play.   I pick up my two toddler sons on the way home and there is plenty of room for them.  My older son named my red Spark “Rojo”.  Luggage space is certainly limited but I have no issue fitting groceries in it.  My mileage has slowly crept up from 35.5 to 37.1 in the 25,000 miles I’ve driven.  It has only been back to the dealership once and that was for an airbag recall.  I do my own maintenance and it is very easy to work on.  I change the oil about every 7000 miles and rotate the tires every 5000.  I think it is important to review cars for what they are supposed to be and not hold them to the wrong standard.  As a commuter car or even just running around town, the Spark far exceeds any expectations I had.   It isn’t a track day car, a luxury sedan, or whatever else you might want to compare it to.  Yeah, the plastic is hard in the interior. I paid $13,500 for it with all sorts of dealer incentives.  What did you expect?  And frankly, who cares?  I’m not sitting on the door panels or the dash. Are you too precious to be in the presence of some hard plastic?  It’s small...duh.  I don’t need some expert car reviewer to tell me that.  My Spark is fun, well thought out, reliable and gets great gas mileage.  If you need a second car or a third, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another....enough said...  (except this.. Dear Chevrolet, how much would it have cost to put a dome light in the back of the car?  It is seriously dark back there at night when I’m taking the kids out.)',\n",

       "  \" I got my GM Certified Pre-Owned 2017 Cruze Premier with only 15k miles on it. I went with the intention of buying a Malibu, but after driving the Cruze I was so pleasantly surprised, I bought it instead of the Malibu.  I have only put on a little over 1000 miles in the few weeks I've owned it, but it has not disappointed.    I drive 100+ miles round trip 2-3 days per week for work, through moderate rush hour traffic (so no using cruise control, and some slow downs and stop-and-go traffic), and the seat comfort and ride quality have been great.  I wish in the Premier at least there was adjustable lumbar support, but the seats are plenty comfortable anyway, so no big deal.  The Bluetooth, Android Auto, SiriusXM, voice recognition, etc, all work flawlessly without any hiccups. Climate controls are simple to use.   Performance wise, I'm not sure what the deal is with Edmund's review. Most other review sites put the 0-60 around 8.0 seconds, some even under 8.0 seconds. I would agree with those test results. The 1.4L turbo has plenty of pep. Merging and passing on the freeway is easy. Plenty of instant torque down low in the RPM's.  I had driven a 2016 2.0L Mazda 3i before buying the Cruze, and in daily driving, the Cruze is way more peppy. The Mazda had to get the revs up before it had any power.   Gas mileage for me has been a little over 33 combined, based on miles divided by gallons @ fill ups. The trip computer says about 35 combined, I've had it read as high as 42 in highway driving.  My driving is about 50/50 highway/city. But my highway driving often includes some rush-hour traffic, so it isn't pure highway cruising.  I agree that the engine start-stop feature should have a turn-off. But if I'm in traffic and I don't want it to stop, I simply shift down from D into L, which disables the auto-stop feature.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the my purchase.  We'll see how long-term reliability is, but so far I'm pleased with every other aspect of the car.\",\n",

We have the base model, so I cannot comment on the various power and safety features that would come with the upgraded versions.  It is easy and fun to drive.  The engine is great and gives the car plenty of oomph.  The steering is very good and solid.  Very pleased so far (365 miles).',\n",

Handling, safety, appearance, technology, visibility, fuel efficiency and rear seat room have all been improved. It is the perfect vehicle to take me back and forth from school. Don't let the start/stop technology get you nervous. If I didn't look for it, I wouldn't even know that the engine was turning off as I stopped at a red light. It's a seamless transition as the engine instantly starts the moment that begin to take my foot off the brake.  There is no lag and no hesitation.  The kinetic blue with the RS package looks great and the Apple Car Play works perfectly with my phone.  It was between this and a Civic and this car looked better, offered more and the dealership closed the deal with a great offer.\",\n",

       "  ' Bought my Cruze LT used at a Honda dealer with 11,800 miles on it. The price is what drew me in as it was under $13000 before the dreaded haggle process. I love the car, it\\'s whisper quiet, has good pick up for a small 4 cylinder engine and I average 38 miles a gallon driving highway and city. The car came with heated seats, and the upgraded auto start keyless features. I am very impressed with the 7\" information center as it links my phone apps to the screen. Maps, music, phone contacts and text are all hands free and work like a champ. The cars new sharper lines mimic the new civic and it really makes the car stand out. Many Cruze owners with older models stop and ask me about my experience in the new style. I formerly had a Kia Soul, loved it and it was very reliable, but the Cruze is my new favorite. Trunk space and passenger room is exceptional as well. Highly recommend checking it out.',\n",
       "  ' I rented this car for two days and it was amazing! At 50mpg the cruise control indicated 60mpg and at 70mph it was 42mpg. The claimed 47mpg highway entirely believable if a bit conservative. The range with a full tank (13 gallons) was an indicated 538 miles. These are incredible numbers for a vehicle that is not a diesel and is of this size. The seats were very comfortable. I drove non-stop from Fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville without a single ache or pain. The cabin was very quiet.  I carried on several conversations while on the move and not once did exterior noise interfere. Which gets me to the Bluetooth connectivity. The pairing to my LG Aristo was effortless and connections to it once I started the car were instant. The backup camera was clear with the display being large enough to be effective. The steering assist lines on the display curve as you turn the steering wheel and while I never really got accustomed to them enough to trust what they were telling me, they seemed to be accurate enough. The stereo had easy-to-use controls and had very good sound. The 1.4L turbocharged engine was smooth, quiet and eager to please. Flooring the pedal brought decent acceleration that surprised me every time I did it. The 6 speed automatic shifted crisply and smoothly and never hunted for gears. The brakes were firm, linear, and positive. I love them if only because they are discs front and rear, a feature thankfully becoming the norm, even on small, economy cars. What didn\\'t I like? To be fair, the following will be mere quibbles and nothing in the list would prevent me from buying one or renting one again. My biggest problem with this car was the parking brake. Located as a pedal on the floor, that was at first a nice touch. I like pedal-operated parking brakes because they keep my hands free to grab my belongings in a hurry. But this one was a bit unpleasant. It was mounted fairly high, had very little travel and was stiff. My wife has a 2011 Camry and by comparison that pedal,-operated parking brake is effortless. It was also difficult to tell if it was disengaged fully, forcing me to check the dashboard to see if the indicator light was extinguished. I suspect most owners will opt to not use it and just use the transmission to keep the car from rolling away (a practice I do not subscribe to). The next item on my list is the stop-start feature. This was a welcome feature in and of itself. The engine shut down and restarted so quickly and smoothly that it took several miles before I realized that it was happening! The tachometer does display when it is active by dipping below zero to an area labelled as \"AUTO STOP\". The moment the car comes to a stop the engine shuts down. Release the foot brake and the engine comes to life before your foot gets back on the gas and off you go. Nice. But my problem is that if you take your foot off the brake to creep forward a bit, the feature is disabled entirely and the engine restarts and remains on. Putting the car in Park also causes the engine to restart. If the air con was of and it is turned on, the engine restarts. The engine doesn\\'t remain off for long and restarts (even with your foot still on the brake) after a few minutes. This is understandable because the battery is being depleted with the accessories still running. The windows are all one-shot on the downward travel, but must be held in the up direction. My wife\\'s Camry has one-shot on all windows in both directions. I am yet to understand why other manufacturers don\\'t see this as viable. Who wants to sit there holding window buttons when there are things in the world to be done?!? That manumatic shift feature. I had to Google it to figure out how it worked. And as far as I am concerned it should be deleted entirely. A total waste of engineering, if you ask me. You have to move the shifter down into L range and then press the \"+\" or \"-\" button on top of the selector to get higher or lower gears, respectively. It would be better to have a gate to the left or right of the selector and allow the shifter itself to be toggled...preferably like Mazda correctly has it: pull back for upshifts, push forward for downshifts. The steering was nicely weighted and felt direct, but was a little too sensitive at centre. That made keeping straight in a lane, particularly with crosswinds, a bit tricky. The stereo. Why are the volume up and down controls hidden on the underside of the right hand spoke of the steering wheel?!? And there are two other buttons under the left spoke that I am yet to figure out. What I hate: The reverse lights come on when you exit the car...a stupid and dangerous feature that all GM cars unfortunately currently feature. It gives the impression that the car is backing up and cause a panic situation which may lead to an accident. STOP THIS FOOLISHNESS, GM! Otherwise, this is an amazing little car that deserves consideration.',\n",
       "  \" I've owned the car over 7 months and love it.  I was looking for a good mid-sized used car but kept checking on the new little cars.  I found the deal on this for under $9000 and had to go for it.  I especially liked the technology package, that will connect to my smart phone using all its functionality over the display.  My only concern, after doing my research, was whether I would fit into it as I am 6'3 and over 300 lbs. With the seat all the way back, I was good.  In particular, I found I had all the knee room I would need.  I could take this on a long trip with no real trouble.  The back seat is absolutely useless to me because I do not transport children and an adult would NEVER fit in.  I removed the back seat cushions, folded the seat back down and have what I call a 'two seater wagon'.  I've done a lot of transporting cargo and been surprised what it will carry.  Performance is not sporty by any means, but it is always competent.  Acceleration is adequate and never lacking, steering is what you would expect from a small car, transmission and clutch are fine, and the suspension handles what the road throws at it.  I drive 4 miles to work and every couple of weeks go on weekend excursions, and have gotten 36.7 MPG over the past 5 months. The paint, fit, and finish is wonderful, and the styling is very nice.  All these things I love about the car, but be aware of what it does NOT do.  It does NOT have power seats, windows or mirrors, so get into the habit of cranking windows again.  It does NOT have cruise control.  It does not have remote control for the door locks but it does lock the doors automatically when driving and it will not allow you to unlock the car while the car is running - kind of odd.  The hatch only opens with the key, no remote switch.  With the back seat down, the floor is not flat but is low in the middle.  These negatives are insignificant considering all the positives of the car.  A note on the geopolitics of the car -- it is made in South Korea by what used to be Daewoo.  I never expected to by a GM car after the bailout by taxpayers and I'm still not happy about supporting GM, but this car REALLY gets it done for me so I put politics behind me.I've owned this car for a year and everything I've said about the car is still true.  Gas mileage is still outstanding and there have been zero problems.  I really like it.\",\n",
       "  ' Yesterday my daughter was in a horrifying car crash on I95 in SC when she was in a multi vehicle car accident. If you could see the pictures you’d wonder how ALL 3 in the car escaped without a scrape! The trooper, paramedic and doctor on scene stated they shouldn’t have walked away BUT THEY DID!!

       "  \" World’s cheapest sports car?Car and Driver made this car an “Editors’ Choice” in its category.  Consumer Reports is not quite so thrilled. Easy to see why.  This little puppy is fun to drive, with agile handling and – at least when only the driver on board – plenty of zip to thoroughly enjoy a smooth and winding country road.  Down sides?  On a bumpy road you will get jostled, there’s precious little back seat and cargo room, and the interior on my base LS version is heavy on hard plastic. Plan on seat pads for long trips.  But I can hardly quibble when I snagged an automatic for $10,500, replete with up-to-date electronics, ten airbags, tire pressure monitoring, Bluetooth and ONStar – but no cruise and no power on anything in the doors.  Still, I haven’t paid that little for a brand new automatic since 1989.  And well built?  It’s so tightly fitted that, windows all up, you have to give the door a firm little slam to overcome the air compression.This is the six month update prompted by Edmunds.  No news is good news.  Turned it over to my daughter and she's been driving it around Seattle, and out for a couple camping trips on back roads.  Zero problems.And now the one year prompted update.  Still zero problems at 7000 miles so upgraded reliability to five stars.\",\n",

       "  \" Truly impressed so far. Have only put 2500 miles on it. It's by far the neatest car I've ever owned. Not saying a whole lot there. The last new car I bought was a 94 Olds Achieva. That was sporty back in those days. I'd say the Spark is funner to drive. Since then I've owned old pickup trucks and used cars, so the Spark is high tech to me. I drive once a month a 500 mile round trip and around town besides that. It seems to have a slight lull in accelaration as if pressing the gas takes a wee too long before it starts going. I've gotten used to it, and it's really not a problem. Acceleration is remarkably quick, and I have no problem on the interstate keeping up. Love the cruise control and use it in places I've never used cruise control before because it's so convenient. Get up to speed limit and move my thumb on the steering wheel, and let it go. Defogger and rear wiper are neat. My daughter thinks that's cool. Backup camera is cool, but beware that objects appear further away than they really are. Still use the mirrors to be sure. Visibility is great. Wifi is the cat's meow, and checking the car's location or unlocking it with my phone is awesome. So far, so good. I can afford it, and feel I have one of the nicest cars on the road, in spite of it looking like a puddle jumper.\",\n",
       "  ' I am a simple kind of guy, and my goal with getting another vehicle was very simple – get a new vehicle at a reasonably low price. Happily, the 2017 Spark is simple in all the ways I like – I got the base LS model because I’m not a fan of power anything (power stuff breaks first). The only “power” options I wanted and got on the Spark were power steering and an automatic transmission. The most common descriptor my friends use for the Spark is “cute.” It’s quite a small vehicle, but it’s one I have no problem fitting my 5’ 11”, 230-pound frame into. The seats, while not easy-chair material, are sufficiently comfortable. The Spark is good with mirrors and window space – blind spots on either side of the car have been kept to a minimum. The rear-view mirror inside the cabin could be a little wider, but it’s adequate. And the rear window is wide enough to monitor tailgaters.Internal storage space, as has been widely written about, isn’t very much, but you can fold the rear seats down for additional space. It also has two rear doors which might be suitable for loading large items as well as associates.Much has also been written about the Spark’s 98-horsepower engine and that it takes 10 seconds to get to 60 mph. I have not found it to be a problem. I would not call it underpowered at all. If you’re an angry, pushy driver who loves to tailgate others, the Spark will exhaust your patience. But if you’re a judicious, considerate driver, the Spark’s acceleration won’t be an issue for you. I was a little surprised to find out the Spark has a 9.2-gallon tank – the smallest in any vehicle I’ve ever owned, but that’s offset by its high-rated fuel mileage of 38mpg (highway) and up. If you do the math, that’s a cruising range of at least 340 miles. This is not a “touring” car, but for 180- to 250-mile trips that I take on occasion, I’m confident the Spark can handle the pull. The deal clincher for me was under the hood – the EcoTec engine, this one a 1.4-liter jobbie – is the centerpiece of the Spark. I became a huge fan of EcoTec with my last car which lasted over 296,000 miles with that original engine. Unlike the Fiat 500, you can use 87 octane fuel with the Spark.Compared with what I’ve read about similar subcompacts, the Spark’s instrument panel and dash are welcomingly simple and very nicely designed. No screen is too “busy”. If you have an Android or iPhone smartphone, you can plug either device into the USB jack and access music and certain mobile apps from those devices on the touch-screen display. The semi-digital dash on the base model is the carries a nice amount of information including mpg, miles to empty, and average speed. The 1LT and 2LT models are supposed to be even better on this point.The radio does NOT pick up HD channels (at least not in the base model), so get your premium stations thru your Bluetooth enabled smartphone and apps like Sirius XM or Pandora. The Spark includes several modern conveniences and safety features such as a rear backup camera and the MyChevy touch-screen control system with Bluetooth. You get a 3-month trial of OnStar remote monitoring and assistance free, too, as well as built-in 4G wi-fi service you can add on for as little as $10 a month (1 GB). Automatic lights, cup holders, and too many other features to include in this short review.The Spark is a good, simple little car that has in reviews been compared favorably in specific ways to the pricier Honda Fit, the trendy Fiat 500, the practical Nissan Versa, and the equally reliable Toyota Yaris. The Spark stands out, though, for its integrated OnStar service and onboard technology. If you’re in a precarious situation with savings or credit score, and you need basic transportation, you’ll like the Spark a lot. If you’re a road hog, or a gearhead, look elsewhere.  The Spark is most certainly not a ride for hipsters (unless they’re driving it ironically). For its high fuel mileage, its maneuverability in tight parking spaces, its safety features, and its integrated smartphone technology, not to mention its low price relative to other vehicles in its class, the 2017 Spark earns its 5 stars overall. Just a few things keep it from being an absolutely perfect subcompact, but no one has made one of those yet!Take a test drive! You’ll love it!',\n",

I was skeptical to get the four cylinder engine, but I am glad I did.  The engine is a direct injection that runs very smooth and saves gas.  I have taken the truck on several road trips with excellent gas mileage.  The biggest plus is the comfort.  For a taller driver (6'2) the leg room is ample and allows you to stretch out.  The rear seats are ok for space and comfort.  The onboard computer systems are very user friendly and easy to navigate.

Plus you can access things in the back from the 2nd door instead of crawling over the pickup bed with a topper is a big plus.  I'd never go back to a pickup.

That includes a lot of mountain and curve driving and I was very pleased.  The freeway driving was at 75 mph.  That's about a 2.5 mpg increase over the '14 that I traded in with 55,000 mi with absolutely no problems.  I have the cocoa/dune interior and I think that it is very classy and attractive.  The only problem I have with the new style Suburban is the sloping rear floor.  Twice we have had items roll out the back when the door was opened.  One was a glass grocery jar that broke on the asphalt.  I'm hoping that they address this issue on the next version.  The ride is wonderful and this vehicle is made to take long trips.\",\n",

      "1. **Hypothermia and Frostbite**: Prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can lead to hypothermia (body temperature below 95°F/35°C) and frostbite (damage to skin and underlying tissues due to freezing). Both can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n",
      "2. **Reduced Mobility**: Cold weather can make it difficult to move around, especially for older adults, young children, and people with certain medical conditions. Icy roads, sidewalks, and surfaces can cause falls and injuries.\n",
      "3. **Limited Access to Basic Amenities**: In extreme cold, essential services like water, electricity, and heating may be disrupted or unavailable. This can make daily life, including basic hygiene and cooking, a significant struggle.\n",
      "4. **Higher Energy Consumption**: Maintaining a warm indoor temperature requires more energy, which can increase bills and may not be feasible for everyone.\n",
      "5. **Mental Health Challenges**: Living in extreme cold can lead to feelings of isolation, Cabin Fever, and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which can negatively impact mental health and well-being.\n",
      "6. **Increased Risk of Respiratory Issues**: Cold air can exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia.\n",
      "7. **Food and Water Challenges**: In extreme cold, food and water supplies may be limited or spoiled, making it difficult to access fresh and nutritious food and water.\n",
      "8. **Travel and Commuting Difficulties**: Extreme cold can make travel and commuting hazardous, with increased risk of accidents, road closures, and delayed transportation services.\n",
      "9. **Impact on Agriculture and Food Production**: Extreme cold temperatures can damage or destroy crops, leading to food shortages and economic losses.\n",
      "10. **Animals and Pets**: Livestock and pets may struggle to adapt to extreme cold, leading to health issues, mortality, and financial losses for farmers and pet owners.\n",
      "11. **Building and Infrastructure Damage**: Prolonged exposure to cold temperatures can cause damage to buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure, leading to costly repairs and maintenance.\n",
      "12. **Health Concerns for Vulnerable Populations**: Extreme cold can disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including the elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions, making them more susceptible to health complications.\n",

      "1. Quality Control: The first review highlights the importance of quality control, stating that \"quantity over quality mentality\" is a significant issue. Ensuring that the cars are thoroughly inspected and tested before being shipped out to customers can help minimize the number of defective vehicles.\n",
      "2. Communication: The first review also mentions that the salesperson did not properly explain the features of the car, which led to disappointment. Improving communication with customers, especially during the sales process, can help build trust and ensure that customers understand what they're getting.\n",
      "3. Warranty and Repair: The third review emphasizes the importance of having a reliable warranty and repair process. Ensuring that issues are efficiently addressed and covered by warranty can help build trust with customers.\n",
      "4. Product Design and Durability: The fourth review criticizes the design and durability of the car, stating that it's \"not in the same league as the ones from the other more famous manufacturers.\" Improving the design and durability of the car can help increase customer satisfaction.\n",
      "5. Customer Service: The fifth review highlights poor customer service, stating that the company has a small footprint in the states and doesn't have the resources to back up its warranties. Improving customer service can help build trust with customers and increase satisfaction.\n",
      "6. Reliability: Multiple reviews mention reliability issues, including faulty brakes, transmission problems, and engine issues. Ensuring that the cars are reliable and can withstand the rigors of daily driving can help increase customer satisfaction.\n",
      "7. Testing and Validation: The first review highlights the importance of testing and validation, stating that \"they spend millions of $$$ for research, testing etc. and yet these basic things slip right by.\" Ensuring that the cars are thoroughly tested and validated before being shipped out to customers can help minimize the number of defective vehicles.\n",
      "8. Dealer Network: The third review criticizes the dealership network, stating that the service reps and mechanics are limited and inefficient. Improving the dealership network can help increase customer satisfaction.\n",
      "9. Transparency: The third review mentions that the company was unwilling to recall the problematic headlight capsules, which led to distrust. Being transparent about issues and addressing them promptly can help build trust with customers.\n",
      "10. Continuous Improvement: The first review highlights the importance of continuous improvement, stating that \"they have to be willing to make changes.\" Continuously gathering feedback and making improvements can help increase customer satisfaction over time.\n",
