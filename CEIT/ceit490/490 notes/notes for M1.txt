Robotics: AI interacts with the physical world (e.g., drones, industrial robots).
Computer Vision: Uses deep learning for image processing, object detection, and enhancement 

NLP: Handles tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and speech recognition.

Key Ideas:
AI systems acquire, learn from, and interact with data.
Practical examples include sentiment analysis using NLP.
NLP basically tokenizes the words with their meanings in some type of hyper space using matrices, 
and guessing the next Word according their closeness in text processing. For audio proccessing it uses frequencies; and for 
image proccessing it uses pixels for this process.

Next goal of ai: Applying AI across different fields based on algorithm knowledge.

AI organizations focuses on some areas:
Data strategy: It’s all about having a plan to use data effectively—setting goals, figuring out where to get the data, and putting processes in place to make it useful for decision-making.

AI Infrastructure: This means choosing between cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for flexibility and scalability or sticking with on-premises solutions to have more control over data and how it's managed.

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations): This is about keeping your ML systems running smoothly from start to finish. It covers everything from planning and prepping data, to training models, deploying them, and continuously improving. The key stages are:
*Planning, Prepairing the data, Training and Evaluating models, Deployment, Monitoring and Maintenance
